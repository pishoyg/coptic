  <h3 id="micah1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of
  the Lord came to Michaeas the son of Morasthi, in the days of Joatham, and
  Achaz, and Ezekias, kings of Juda, concerning what he saw regarding Samaria
  and Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Hear these words, ye
  people; and let the earth give heed, and all that are in it: and the Lord God
  shall be among you for a testimony, the Lord out of his holy habitation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For, behold, the Lord comes forth out
  of his place, and will come down, and will go upon the high places of the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the mountains shall be
  shaken under him, and the valleys shall melt like wax before the fire, and as
  water rushing down a declivity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> All
  these calamities are for the transgression of Jacob, and for the sin of the
  house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and
  what is the sin of the house of Juda? is it not Jerusalem? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore I will make Samaria as a store-house of
  the fruits of the field, and as a planting of a vineyard: and I will utterly
  demolish her stones, and I will expose her foundations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they shall cut in pieces all the graven
  images, and all that she has hired they shall burn with fire, and I will
  utterly destroy all her idols: because she has gathered of the hires of
  fornication, and of the hires of fornication has she amassed wealth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Therefore shall she lament and wail,
  she shall go barefooted, and being naked she shall make lamentation as that
  of serpents, and mourning as of the daughters of sirens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For her plague has become grievous; for it has
  come even to Juda; and has reached to the gate of my people, even to
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Ye that are in Geth, exalt
  not yourselves, and ye Enakim, do not rebuild from the ruins of the house in
  derision: sprinkle dust in the place of your laughter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The inhabitant of Sennaar, fairly inhabiting her
  cities, came not forth to mourn for the house next to her: she shall receive
  of you the stroke of grief. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Who has
  begun to act for good to her that dwells in sorrow? for calamities have come
  down from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> even a sound of chariots and horsemen: the
  inhabitants of Lachis, she is the leader of sin to the daughter of Sion: for
  in thee were found the transgressions of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore shall he cause men to be sent forth as
  far as the inheritance of Geth, even vain houses; they are become vanity to
  the kings of Israel; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> until they bring
  the heirs, O inhabitant of Lachis: the inheritance shall reach to Odollam,
  even the glory of the daughter of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Shave thine hair, and make thyself bald for thy
  delicate children; increase thy widowhood as an eagle; for thy people are
  gone into captivity from thee.
  <h3 id="micah2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> They meditated
  troubles, and wrought wickedness on their beds, and they put it in execution
  with the daylight; for they have not lifted up their hands to God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And they desired fields, and plundered
  orphans, and oppressed families, and spoiled a man and his house, even a man
  and his inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Therefore thus
  saith the Lord; Behold, I devise evils against this family, out of which ye
  shall not lift up your necks, neither shall ye walk upright speedily: for the
  time is evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> In that day shall a
  parable be taken up against you, and a plaintive lamentation shall be
  uttered, saying, We are thoroughly miserable: the portion of my people has
  been measured out with a line, and there was none to hinder him so as to turn
  him back; your fields have been divided. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Therefore thou shalt have no one to cast a line
  for the lot. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Weep not with tears in
  the assembly of the Lord, neither let any weep for these things; for he shall
  not remove the reproaches, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> who says,
  The house of Jacob has provoked the Spirit of the Lord; are not these his
  practices? Are not the Lord’s words right with him? and have they not
  proceeded correctly? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Even beforetime
  my people withstood him as an enemy against his peace; they have stripped off
  his skin to remove hope in the conflict of war. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The leaders of my people shall be cast forth from
  their luxurious houses; they are rejected because of their evil practices;
  draw ye near to the everlasting mountains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Arise thou, and depart; for this is not thy rest
  because of uncleanness: ye have been utterly destroyed; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> ye have fled, no one pursuing you: thy spirit has
  framed falsehood, it has dropped on thee for wine and strong drink. But it
  shall come to pass, that out of the dropping of this people, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Jacob shall be completely gathered with all his
  people: I will surely receive the remnant of Israel; I will cause them to
  return together, as sheep in trouble, as a flock in the midst of their fold:
  they shall rush forth from among men through the breach made before them:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> they have broken through, and passed
  the gate, and gone out by it: and their king has gone out before them, and
  the Lord shall lead them.
  <h3 id="micah3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he shall
  say, Hear now these words, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and ye remnant of
  the house of Israel; is it not for you to know judgment? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> who hate good, and seek evil; who tear their skins
  off them, and their flesh off their bones: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> even as they devoured the flesh of my people, and
  stripped their skins off them, and broke their bones, and divided them as
  flesh for the caldron, and as meat for the pot, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> thus they shall cry to the Lord, but he shall not
  hearken to them; and he shall turn away his face from them at that time,
  because they have done wickedly in their practices against themselves.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus saith the Lord concerning the
  prophets that lead my people astray, that bit with their teeth, and proclaim
  peace to them; and when nothing was put into their mouth, they raised up war
  against them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> therefore there shall be
  night to you instead of a vision, and there shall be to you darkness instead
  of prophecy; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall
  be dark upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the seers of
  night-visions shall be ashamed, and the prophets shall be laughed to scorn:
  and all the people shall speak against them, because there shall be none to
  hearken to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Surely I will
  strengthen myself with the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of power,
  to declare to Jacob his transgressions, and to Israel his sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Hear now these words, ye chiefs of the house of
  Jacob, and the remnant of the house of Israel, who hate judgment, and pervert
  all righteousness; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> who build up Sion
  with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The heads thereof have judged for gifts, and the
  priests thereof have answered for hire, and her prophets have divined for
  silver: and yet they have rested on the Lord, saying, Is not the Lord among
  us? no evil shall come upon us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Therefore on your account Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem
  shall be as a storehouse of fruits, and the mountain of the house as a grove
  of the forest.
  <h3 id="micah4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And at the last
  days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the tops of
  the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and the peoples shall
  hasten to it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And many nations shall
  go, and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house
  of the God of Jacob; and they shall shew us his way, and we will walk in his
  paths: for out of Sion shall go forth a law, and the word of the Lord from
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he shall judge among
  many peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat
  their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles; and nation
  shall no more lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war
  any more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And every one shall rest
  under his vine, and every one under his fig-tree; and there shall be none to
  alarm them: for the mouth of the Lord Almighty has spoken these words.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For all other nations shall walk
  everyone in his own way, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for
  ever and ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> In that day, saith the
  Lord, I will gather her that is bruised, and will receive her that is cast
  out, and those whom I rejected. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I
  will make her that was bruised a remnant, and her that was rejected a mighty
  nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Sion from henceforth,
  even for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And thou, dark tower of
  the flock, daughter of Sion, on thee the dominion shall come and enter in,
  even the first kingdom from Babylon to the daughter of Jerusalem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And now, why hast thou known
  calamities? was there not a king to thee? or has thy counsel perished that
  pangs as of a woman in travail have seized upon thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Be in pain, and strengthen thyself, and draw
  near, O daughter of Sion, as a woman in travail: for now thou shalt go forth
  out of the city, and shalt lodge in the plain, and shalt reach even to
  Babylon: thence shall the Lord thy God deliver thee, and thence shall he
  redeem thee out of the hand of thine enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And now have many nations gathered against thee,
  saying, We will rejoice, and our eyes shall look upon Sion. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But they know not the thought of the Lord, and
  have not understood his counsel: for he has gathered them as sheaves of the
  floor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Arise, and thresh them, O
  daughter of Sion: for I will make thine horns iron, and I will make thine
  hoofs brass: and thou shalt utterly destroy many nations, and shalt
  consecrate their abundance to the Lord, and their strength to the Lord of all
  the earth.
  <h3 id="micah5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now shall the
  daughter of Sion be completely hedged in: he has laid siege against us: they
  shall smite the tribes of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And thou, Bethleem, house of Ephratha, art few in
  number to be reckoned among the thousands of Juda; yet out of thee shall one
  come forth to me, to be a ruler of Israel; and his goings forth were from the
  beginning, even from eternity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Therefore shall he appoint them to wait till the time of her that travails:
  she shall bring forth, and then the remnant of their brethren shall return to
  the children of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord
  shall stand, and see, and feed his flock with power, and they shall dwell in
  the glory of the name of the Lord their God: for now shall they be magnified
  to the ends of the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And she
  shall have peace when Assur shall come into your land, and when he shall come
  up upon your country; and there shall be raised up against him seven
  shepherds, and eight attacks of men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And they shall tend the Assyrian with a sword, and the land of Nebrod with
  her trench: and he shall deliver you from the Assyrian, when he shall come
  upon your land, and when he shall invade your coasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the
  Gentiles in the midst of many peoples, as dew falling from the Lord, and as
  lambs on the grass; that none may assemble nor resist among the sons of men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the remnant of Jacob shall be
  among the Gentiles in the midst of many nations, as a lion in the forest
  among cattle, and as a lion’s whelp among the flocks of sheep, even as when
  he goes through, and selects, and carries off his prey, and there is none to
  deliver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thine hand shall be lifted up
  against them that afflict thee, and all thine enemies shall be utterly
  destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And it shall come to pass
  in that day, saith the Lord, that I will utterly destroy the horses out of
  the midst of thee, and destroy thy chariots; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and I will utterly destroy the cities of thy
  land, and demolish all thy strong-holds: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and I will utterly destroy thy sorceries out of
  thine hands; and there shall be no soothsayers in thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I will utterly destroy thy graven images, and
  thy statues out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt never any more worship
  the works of thine hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will
  cut off the groves out of the midst of thee, and I will abolish thy cities.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and I will execute vengeance on the
  heathen in anger and wrath, because they hearkened not.
  <h3 id="micah6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hear now a word:
  the Lord God has said; Arise, plead with the mountains, and let the hills
  hear thy voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Hear ye, O mountains,
  the controversy of the Lord, and ye valleys even the foundations of the
  earth: for the Lord has a controversy with his people, and will plead with
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> O my people, what have I done
  to thee? or wherein have I grieved thee? or wherein have I troubled thee?
  answer me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For I brought tee up out of
  the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, and sent
  before thee Moses, and Aaron, and Mariam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> O my people, remember now, what counsel Balac king
  of Moab took against thee, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from
  the reeds to Galgal; that the righteousness of the Lord might be known.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Wherewithal shall I reach the Lord,
  and lay hold of my God most high? shall I reach him by whole-burnt-offerings,
  by calves of a year old? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Will the Lord
  accept thousands of rams, or ten thousands of fat goats? should I give my
  first-born for ungodliness, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Has it not been told thee, O man, what
  is good? or what does the Lord require of thee, but to do justice, and love
  mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord thy God? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The Lord’s voice shall be proclaimed in the city,
  and he shall save those that fear his name: hear, O tribe; and who shall
  order the city? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Is there not fire,
  and the house of the wicked heaping up wicked treasures, and that with the
  pride of unrighteousness? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Shall the
  wicked be justified by the balanced, or deceitful weights in the bag,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> whereby they have accumulated their
  ungodly wealth, and they that dwell in the city have uttered falsehoods, and
  their tongue has been exalted in their mouth? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore will I begin to smite thee; I will
  destroy thee in thy sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou shalt
  eat, and shalt not be satisfied; and there shall be darkness upon thee; and
  he shall depart from thee, and thou shalt not escape; and all that shall
  escape shall be delivered over to the sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou
  shalt press the olive, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil; and shalt
  make wine, but ye shall drink no wine: and the ordinances of my people shall
  be utterly abolished. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For thou hast
  kept the statues of Zambri, and done all the works of the house of Achaab;
  and ye have walked in their ways, that I might deliver thee to utter
  destruction, and those that inhabit the city to hissing: and ye shall bear
  the reproach of nations.
  <h3 id="micah7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Alas for me! for
  I am become as one gathering straw in harvest, and as one gathering
  grape-gleanings in the vintage, when there is no cluster for me to eat the
  first-ripe fruit: alas my soul! <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For
  the godly is perished from the earth; and there is none among men that orders
  his way aright: they all quarrel even to blood: they grievously afflict every
  one his neighbour: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> they prepare their
  hands for mischief, the prince asks a reward, and the judge speaks flattering
  words; it is the desire of their soul: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  therefore I will take away their goods as a devouring moth, and as one who
  acts by a rigid rule in a day of visitation. Woe, woe, thy times of vengeance
  are come; now shall be their lamentations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Trust not in friends, and confide not in guides:
  beware of thy wife, so as not to commit anything to her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For the son dishonours his father, the daughter
  will rise up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her
  mother-in-law: those in his house shall be all a man’s enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But I will look to the Lord; I will wait upon God
  my Saviour: my God will hearken to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Rejoice not against me, mine enemy; for I have fallen yet shall arise; for
  though I should sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light to me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I will bear the indignation of the
  Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he make good my cause: he also
  shall maintain my right, and shall bring me out to the light, and I shall
  behold his righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And she
  that is mine enemy shall see it, and shall clothe herself with shame, who
  says, Where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall look upon her: now shall she
  be for trampling as mire in the ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  It is the day of making of brick; that day shall be thine utter destruction,
  and that day shall utterly abolish thine ordinances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thy cities shall be levelled, and parted
  among the Assyrians; and thy strong cities shall be parted from Tyre to the
  river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the land shall be utterly desolate together
  with them that inhabit it, because of the fruit of their doings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Tend thy people with thy rod, the sheep of thine
  inheritance, those that inhabit by themselves the thicket in the midst of
  Carmel: they shall feed in the land of Basan, and in the land of Galaad, as
  in the days of old. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And according to
  the days of thy departure out of Egypt shall ye see marvellous things.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The nations shall see and be ashamed;
  and at all their might they shall lay their hands upon their mouth, their
  ears shall be deafened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They shall
  lick the dust as serpents crawling on the earth, they shall be confounded in
  their holes; they shall be amazed at the Lord our God, and will be afraid of
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Who is a God like thee,
  cancelling iniquities, and passing over the sins of the remnant of his
  inheritance? and he has not kept his anger for a testimony, for he delights
  in mercy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> He will return and have
  mercy upon us; he will sink our iniquities, and they shall be cast into the
  depth of the sea, even all our sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  He shall give blessings truly to Jacob, and mercy to Abraam, as thou swarest
  to our fathers, according to the former days.
