  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I. Paul and Silouanos and Timotheos
  to the church of Thessalonike in God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:
  (the) grace to you and (the) peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> We give thanks to God always
  for you all, remembering you in our prayers unfailingly, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> remembering (the) work of your faith and (the)
  toil of the love and the patience and the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ
  before God and our Father; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> knowing,
  our brethren whom God loved, your election, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> because our Gospel came not to you in (the) word
  only, but in [a] power and [a] holy spirit and much comfort. According as ye
  know the manner (in) which we became to you because of you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye also became like to us and the Lord, having
  received the word in a great tribulation and a joy of the holy spirit;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> so that ye became (an) example to all
  who believe in (the) Makedonia and [the] Achaia. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For (the) word of the Lord spread abroad from you
  not only in (the) Makedonia and [the] Achaia, but in every place your faith,
  which is toward God, was spread abroad; so that we (pron.) have not need of
  speaking concerning anything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For they
  (are they) who speak concerning us, concerning (the) manner of the entering
  which we had (chi to you; and the manner (in which) ye turned to God from the
  idols, to be servant of God, the living (and) true; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and to look out forward to his Son from the
  heavens, he whom he raised from them who are dead, Jesus, who will save us
  from (the) wrath which cometh.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_thessalonians2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For ye (pron.) know, our brethren,
  our entering which we had (t.uni) to you, that it was not empty: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> but we suffered before and we were insulted,
  according as ye know, namely in Philippois: we were emboldened in our God to
  speak to you the Gospel of God in a great conflict. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For our exhortation was not from [an] error, nor
  from [an] uncleanness, nor from [a] subtlety: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but according as we were approved by God to be
  entrusted with the Gospel, thus we speak.Not as some, pleasing [the] men, but
  God who approveth our hearts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For
  neither were we ever found in [a] word of flattery, according as ye know, nor
  in an excuse for a wrongdoing, God witnesseth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> nor were we seeking for glory from [the] men, nor
  of you, nor of others, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> it being
  possible for us to be for a burden as apostles of Christ. But we became
  little children in your midst, as a nurse cherishing her children:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> thus being greatly in love of you, we
  were well pleased to give to you not only the Gospel of God, but also our
  souls, because that ye were to us beloved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For remember, our brethren, our toil and our pain:
  working by night and day, that we might not add burden upon one of you, we
  proclaimed among you the Gospel of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Ye (are they) who witness, and God, that holily
  and righteously and unblameably we were to you, namely those who believe.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> According as ye know that as a father
  beseecheth his children, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> thus we are
  beseeching each one of you and exhorting you and witnessing, that ye walk
  worthy of God, he who called you into his kingdom and his glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And therefore we also give thanks to God
  unceasingly, that, having received the word of (the) hearing of God through
  us, ye received it not as a word of man, but as truly being a word of God,
  which is that which worketh in you, namely those who believe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For ye, our brethren, became like to the churches
  of God which are in [the] Joudēa in Christ Jesus: because ye also received
  the same pains by your fellow tribesmen, according as we also suffered from
  the Jews; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> who killed the Lord Jesus
  and the prophets, and us also persecuted; and they please not God, being
  opposers of all men; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> preventing us
  from speaking to the Gentiles that they may be saved; unto (the) completing
  their sins always: but the anger came upon them unto the end <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But we, our brethren, were bereaved of you for
  the space (lit. a time) of an hour, in presence, and not in (the) heart; we
  hastened exceedingly to see your face in a great desire: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> because we wished to come to you, I indeed, Paul,
  once and twice (lit. two); and Satan prevented. me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For what is our hope or our joy or (the) crown of
  our boast? Are not ye before our Lord Jesus in his coming? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For ye are our glory and our joy.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_thessalonians3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Therefore not being able to stay,
  we were well pleased to be left alone in Athēnnas; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and we sent our brother Timotheos to you, and
  minister of God in the Gospel of Christ, to confirm you and pray for your
  faith; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> that no one might be moved in
  these tribulations. For ye (pron.) know that we were set for this thing:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> for even when we were with you, we
  were beforehand in saying to you that we shall (lit. will) be oppressed;
  according as it came to pass and ye know. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Therefore I also am unable to be long-suffering, I
  sent to know your faith, lest by any means he who tempteth tempted you, and
  your toil became empty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But now
  Timotheos having come to me from with you, and having said to us (the) good
  tidings of your faith and your love, and that our good remembrance (is) in
  you, loving to see us, according as is with us also unto you; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> therefore we were consoled about you, our
  brethren, for all your necessity and all your tribulation through your faith:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> because now we live, should ye stand
  in the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For what thanksgiving is
  it possible for us to give in return to the Lord for all the joy with which
  we rejoice for you before our God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> in
  the day and the night praying more (and) more unto the seeing your face, and
  unto perfecting the deficiencies of your faith? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But God himself, our Father, and our Lord Jesus
  Christ shall dispose our way to you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  but you the Lord shall make to multiply and abound in the love to one another
  and all men, according as it is with us also unto you; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> unto (the) confirming your hearts in [a]
  blamelessness, in [a] holiness before God and our Father, in (the) coming of
  our Lord Jesus Christ with all the saints of his. Amēn.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_thessalonians4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Finally, our brethren, we beseech
  you and we pray you in the Lord Jesus, that according as ye received of us
  (how) to walk, according as is worthy and is pleasing to God, according as
  also ye (do) walk, [that] ye should abound more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For ye know the orders which we delivered to you
  through our Lord Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For this is
  (the) wish of God, your sanctification, to keep yourselves from [the]
  fornication; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> each one of you to know
  his vessel to possess it for himself in [a] sanctification and [an] honour,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> not in [a] passion of [a] lust,
  according as the Gentiles also who know not God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Not to go beyond, not to do his brother wrong in
  (the) deed; because that the Lord is an avenger of all these, according as we
  said to you before, and we witnessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  For God called us not unto [an] uncleanness, but in [a] sanctification.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Therefore he who is disobedient, was
  not being (so) toward man, but God who gave his holy spirit unto you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But concerning [the] brotherly love ye
  have not need (for me) to write to you: for ye are men taught through God to
  love one another; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for even ye do it
  with all the brethren who are in all (the) Makedonia. But we beseech you, our
  brethren, to abound more, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> to study to
  be meek, and to work your own things, and to work with your hands according
  as we ordered you; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that ye may walk
  seemly before them who are without, and have not need of anything.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But we wish you not to be (lit.
  being) ignorant, our brethren, concerning them who sleep; that ye may not
  grieve as (the) rest also who have not hope. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For if we believe that Jesus died and he rose,
  thus they who slept through Jesus, God will bring them with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For this we said to you in (the) word of the
  Lord, that we, namely they who are alive. who will be left unto (the) coming
  of the Lord shall not precede them who slept. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Because the Lord himself with command, with a
  voice of archangel and a trumpet of God, shall come down from (the) heaven,
  and the dead who are in Christ shall rise first: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> afterwards we, namely they who are alive, who
  will be left, shall be caught up with them together in clouds, that we may
  meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall be with the Lord always.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Wherefore comfort one another in
  these words.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_thessalonians5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But concerning the times and the
  seasons, [the] brethren, ye have not need (for me) to write to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For ye (pron.) know perfectly that
  (the) day of the Lord, as a thief in the night thus it cometh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> If they should say: '(The) peace and (the)
  certainty,' then suddenly shall come upon them [a] destruction, as the pang
  which cometh unto her who is with child, and they shall not be able to flee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But ye, our brethren, were not being
  in (the) darkness, that the day may overtake you as thieves: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> for ye all are sons of (the) light, and sons of
  the day: but we (are) not those of the night, nor (are) we those of (the)
  darkness; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> so then let us not sleep as
  (the) rest also, but let us watch and be sober. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For they who sleep slept in the night; and they
  who are drunken were drunken in the night. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But we are those of the day: let us be sober, and
  clothe ourselves with the breastplate of [the] faith and [the] love and the
  helmet of [the] hope of [the] salvation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Because God appointed us not unto [an] anger, but
  unto a saving of our life through our Lord Jesus Christ, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> he who died for us, that whether watching or
  sleeping we shall live with him together. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Therefore comfort one another, and let each one
  of you edify his neighbour, according as also ye do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But we beseech you, our brethren, to know them
  who toil among you, and those who are before you in the Lord, and those who
  instruct you; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and esteem them the
  more in [a] love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> We beseech you, our brethren,
  instruct the unruly, comfort the faint hearted, support them who are weak, be
  longsuffering to all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Take heed, let
  not one do (lit. give an) evil to another (lit. one) in return for an evil,
  but always run after the good with one another and with all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Rejoice always; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> pray unfailingly;. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> give thanks in everything: for this is (the) wish
  of God in Christ Jesus in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Quench
  not the spirit; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> despise not the
  prophecies; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> prove all things; lay
  hold on the good; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> avoid all things
  evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But God himself of the peace
  shall sanctify you together being complete; and he shall keep your spirit
  sound and the soul and the body unblameably in (the) coming of our Lord Jesus
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Faithful is he who calleth
  you, and he will also do (it). <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Our
  brethren, pray for us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Salute one
  another in an holy kiss. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> I adjure you
  by the Lord to read this epistle to all the holy brethren. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> (The) grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you
  all. Amen.</p>
