  <h3 id="judges1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to
  pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel enquired of the
  Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Chananites, to fight
  against them? <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord said, Judas
  shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Judas said to his brother Symeon, Come up with
  me into my lot, and let us array ourselves against the Chananites, and I also
  will go with thee into thy lot: and Symeon went with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Judas went up; and the Lord delivered the
  Chananite and the Pherezite into their hands, and they smote them in Bezek to
  the number of ten thousand men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  they overtook Adonibezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they smote the
  Chananite and the Pherezite. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  Adonibezek fled, and they pursued after him, and took him, and cut off his
  thumbs and his great toes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut
  off, gathered their food under my table: as I therefore have done, so God has
  recompensed me: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the children of Judas fought
  against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote with the edge of the sword, and
  they burnt the city with fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  afterwards the children of Judas went down to fight with the Chananite
  dwelling in the hill country, and the south, and the plain country.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Judas went to the Chananite who
  dwelt in Chebron; and Chebron came out against him; [and the name of Chebron
  before was Cariatharbocsepher:] and they smote Sessi, and Achiman, and
  Tholmi, children of Enac. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they
  went up thence to the inhabitants of Dabir; but the name of Dabir was before
  Cariathsepher, the city of Letters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And Chaleb said, Whosoever shall smite the city of Letters, and shall first
  take it, I will give to him Ascha my daughter to wife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Gothoniel the younger son of Kenez the
  brother of Chaleb took it; and Chaleb gave him his daughter Ascha to wife.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And it came to pass as she went in,
  that Gothoniel urged her to ask a field of her father; and she murmured and
  cried from off her ass, Thou hast sent me forth into a south land: and Chaleb
  said to her, What is thy request? <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And
  Ascha said to him, Give me, I pray thee, a blessing, for thou hast sent me
  forth into a south land, and thou shalt give me the ransom of water: and
  Chaleb gave her according to her heart the ransom of the upper springs and
  the ransom of the low springs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  the children of Jothor the Kenite the father-in-law of Moses went up from the
  city of palm-trees with the children of Judas, to the wilderness that is in
  the south of Juda, which is at the descent of Arad, and they dwelt with the
  people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Judas went with Symeon
  his brother, and smote the Chananite that inhabited Sepheth, and they utterly
  destroyed them; and they called the name of the city Anathema. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But Judas did not inherit Gaza nor her coasts,
  nor Ascalon nor her coasts, nor Accaron nor her coasts, nor Azotus nor the
  lands around it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the Lord was
  with Judas, and he inherited the mountain; for they were not able to destroy
  the inhabitants of the valley, for Rechab prevented them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they gave Chebron to Chaleb, as Moses said;
  and thence he inherited the three cities of the children of Enac.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But the children of Benjamin did not
  take the inheritance of the Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem; and the Jebusite
  dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the sons of Joseph, they also went up to
  Baethel; and the Lord was with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  And they encamped and surveyed Baethel: and the name of the city before was
  Luza. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the spies looked, and
  behold, a man went out of the city, and they took him; and they said to him,
  Shew us the way into the city, and we will deal mercifully with thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he shewed them the way into the
  city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the
  man and his family. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the man went
  into the land of Chettin, and built there a city, and called the name of it
  Luza; this is its name until this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Manasse did not drive out the inhabitants of
  Baethsan, which is a city of Scythians, nor her towns, nor her suburbs; nor
  Thanac, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor her suburbs, nor her
  towns; nor the inhabitant of Balac, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the
  inhabitants of Magedo, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of
  Jeblaam, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; and the Chananite began to dwell in
  this land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And it came to pass when
  Israel was strong, that he made the Chananite tributary, but did not utterly
  drive them out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Ephraim did not
  drive out the Chananite that dwelt in Gazer; and the Chananite dwelt in the
  midst of him in Gazer, and became tributary. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Zabulon did not drive out the inhabitants of
  Kedron, nor the inhabitants of Domana: and the Chananite dwelt in the midst
  of them, and became tributary to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Aser did not drive out the inhabitants of
  Accho, and that people became tributary to him, nor the inhabitants of Dor,
  nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor the inhabitants of Dalaph, nor Aschazi, nor
  Chebda, nor Nai, nor Ereo. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Aser
  dwelt in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land, for he could not
  drive him out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Nephthali did not
  drive out the inhabitants of Baethsamys, nor the inhabitants of Baethanach;
  and Nephthali dwelt in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land: but
  the inhabitants of Bethsamys and of Baetheneth became tributary to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the Amorite drove out the
  children of Dan into the mountains, for they did not suffer them to come down
  into the valley. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the Amorite
  began to dwell in the mountain of shells, in which are bears, and foxes, in
  Myrsinon, and in Thalabin; and the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy upon
  the Amorite, and he became tributary to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the border of the Amorite was from the going
  up of Acrabin, from the rock and upwards.
  <h3 id="judges2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And an angel of
  the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of weeping, and to Baethel, and to
  the house of Israel, and said to them, Thus says the Lord, I brought you up
  out of Egypt, and I brought you into the land which I sware to your fathers;
  and I said, I will never break my covenant that I have made with you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And ye shall make no covenant with
  them that dwell in this land, neither shall ye worship their gods; but ye
  shall destroy their graven images, ye shall pull down their altars: but ye
  hearkened not to my voice, for ye did these things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I said, I will not drive them out from before
  you, but they shall be for a distress to you, and their gods shall be to you
  for an offence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And it came to pass
  when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel,
  that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they named the name of that place Weepings;
  and they sacrificed there to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his inheritance,
  to inherit the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the people
  served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that
  lived many days with Joshua, as many as knew all the great work of the Lord,
  what things he had wrought in Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And Joshua the son of Naue, the servant of the Lord, died, a hundred and ten
  years old. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they buried him in the
  border of his inheritance, in Thamnathares, in mount Ephraim, on the north of
  the mountain of Gaas. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And all that
  generation were laid to their fathers: and another generation rose up after
  them, who knew not the Lord, nor yet the work which he wrought in Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the children of Israel wrought
  evil before the Lord, and served Baalim. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers,
  who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and walked after other gods, of
  the gods of the nations round about them; and they worshipped them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they provoked the Lord, and
  forsook him, and served Baal and the Astartes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord was very angry with Israel; and he
  gave them into the hands of the spoilers, and they spoiled them; and he sold
  them into the hands of their enemies round about, and they could not any
  longer resist their enemies, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> among
  whomsoever they went; and the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as
  the Lord spoke, and as the Lord sware to them; and he greatly afflicted them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the Lord raised up judges, and
  the Lord save them out of the hands of them that spoiled them: and yet they
  hearkened not to the judges, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> for they
  went a whoring after other gods, and worshipped them; and they turned quickly
  out of the way in which their fathers walked to hearken to the words of the
  Lord; they did not so. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And because
  the Lord raised them up judges, so the Lord was with the judge, and saved
  them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord
  was moved at their groaning by reason of them that besieged them and
  afflicted them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And it came to pass
  when the judge died, that they went back, and again corrupted themselves
  worse than their fathers to go after other gods to serve them an to worship
  them: they abandoned not their devices nor their stubborn ways. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and
  said, Forasmuch as this nation has forsaken my covenant which I commanded
  their fathers, and has not hearkened to my voice, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> therefore I will not any more cast out a man of
  the nations before their face, which Joshua the son of Naue left in the land.
  And the Lord left them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> to prove
  Israel with them, whether they would keep the way of the Lord, to walk in it,
  as their fathers kept it, or no. (<span style="color:#b00e23">23</span>) So
  the Lord will leave these nations, so as not to cast them out suddenly; and
  he delivered them not into the hand of Joshua.
  <h3 id="judges3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And these are
  the nations which the Lord left to prove Israel with them, all that had not
  known the wars of Chanaan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Only for
  the sake of the generations of Israel, to teach them war, only the men before
  them knew them not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The five lordships
  of the Phylistines, and every Chananite, and the Sidonian, and the Evite who
  dwelt in Libanus from the mount of Aermon to Laboemath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And this was done in order to prove Israel by
  them, to know whether they would obey the commands of the Lord, which he
  charged their fathers by the hand of Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of
  the Chananite, and the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Pherezite, and the
  Evite, and the Jebusite. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they took
  their daughters for wives to themselves, and they gave their daughters to
  their sons, and served their gods. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgot the Lord
  their God, and served Baalim and the groves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and sold
  them into the hand of Chusarsathaim king of Syria of the rivers: and the
  children of Israel served Chusarsathaim eight years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; and
  the Lord raised up a saviour to Israel, and he saved them, Gothoniel the son
  of Kenez, the brother of Chaleb younger than himself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he
  judged Israel; and he went out to war against Chusarsathaim: and the Lord
  delivered into his hand Chusarsathaim king of Syria of the rivers, and his
  hand prevailed against Chusarsathaim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And the land was quiet forty years; and Gothoniel the son of Kenez died.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the children of Israel continued
  to do evil before the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglom king of Moab
  against Israel, because they had done evil before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he gathered to himself all the children of
  Ammon and Amalec, and went and smote Israel, and took possession of the city
  of Palm-trees. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the children of
  Israel served Eglom the king of Moab eighteen years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; and
  he raised up to them a saviour, Aod the son of Gera a son of Jemeni, a man
  who used both hands alike: and the children of Israel sent gifts by his hand
  to Eglom king of Moab. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Aod made
  himself a dagger of two edges, of a span long, and he girded it under his
  cloak upon his right thigh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he
  went, and brought the presents to Eglom king of Moab, and Eglom was a very
  handsome man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And it came to pass
  when Aod had made an end of offering his gifts, that he dismissed those that
  brought the gifts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he himself
  returned from the quarries that are by Galgal; and Aod said, I have a secret
  errand to thee, O king! and Eglom said to him, Be silent: and he sent away
  from his presence all who waited upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Aod went in to him; and he sat in his own
  upper summer chamber quite alone; and Aod said, I have a message from God to
  thee, O king: and Eglom rose up from his throne near him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And it came to pass as he arose, that Aod
  stretched forth his left hand, and took the dagger off his right thigh, and
  plunged it into his belly; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and drove
  in also the haft after the blade, and the fat closed in upon the blade, for
  he drew not out the dagger from his belly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Aod went out to the porch, and passed out by
  the appointed guards, and shut the doors of the chamber upon him, and locked
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he went out: and Eglom’s
  servants came, and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber were
  locked; and they said, Does he not uncover his feet in the summer-chamber?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they waited till they were
  ashamed, and, behold, there was no one that opened the doors of the upper
  chamber; and they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was
  fallen down dead upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And
  Aod escaped while they were in a tumult, and no one paid attention to him;
  and he passed the quarries, and escaped to Setirotha. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And it came to pass when Aod came into the land
  of Israel, that he blew the horn in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel
  came down with him from the mountain, and he was before them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he said to them, Come down after me, for the
  Lord God has delivered our enemies, even Moab, into our hand; and they went
  down after him, and seized on the fords of Jordan before Moab, and he did not
  suffer a man to pass over. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they
  smote Moab on that day about ten thousand men, every lusty person and every
  mighty man; and not a man escaped. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> So
  Moab was humbled in that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest
  eighty years; and Aod judged them till he died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And after him rose up Samegar the son of Dinach,
  and smote the Philistines to the number of six hundred men with a ploughshare
  such as is drawn by oxen; and he too delivered Israel.
  <h3 id="judges4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  children of Israel continued to do evil against the Lord; and Aod was dead.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord sold the children of
  Israel into the hand of Jabin king of Chanaan, who ruled in Asor; and the
  chief of his host was Sisara, and he dwelt in Arisoth of the Gentiles.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the children of Israel cried to
  the Lord, because he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily
  oppressed Israel twenty years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  Debbora, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, —she judged Israel at that time.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And she sat under the palm-tree of
  Debbora between Rama and Baethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel
  went up to her for judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  Debbora sent and called Barac the son of Abineem out of Cades Nephthali, and
  she said to him, Has not the Lord God of Israel commanded thee? and thou
  shalt depart to mount Thabor, and shalt take with thyself ten thousand men of
  the sons of Nephthali and of the sons of Zabulon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will bring to thee to the torrent of Kison
  Sisara the captain of the host of Jabin, and his chariots, and his multitude,
  and I will deliver them into thine hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Barac said to her, If thou wilt go with me, I
  will go; and if thou wilt not go, I will not go; for I know not the day on
  which the Lord prospers his messenger with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And she said, I will surely go with thee; but know
  that thy honour shall not attend on the expedition on which thou goest, for
  the Lord shall sell Sisara into the hands of a women: and Debbora arose, and
  went with Barac out of Cades. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  Barac called Zabulon and Nephthali out of Cades, and there went up at his
  feet ten thousand men, and Debbora went up with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Chaber the Kenite had removed from Caina,
  from the sons of Jobab the father-in-law of Moses, and pitched his tent by
  the oak of the covetous ones, which is near Kedes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And it was told Sisara that Barac the son of
  Abineem was gone up to mount Thabor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And Sisara summoned all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron and all
  the people with him, from Arisoth of the Gentiles to the brook of Kison.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Debbora said to Barac, Rise up,
  for this is the day on which the Lord has delivered Sisara into thy hand, for
  the Lord shall go forth before thee: and Barac went down from mount Thabor,
  and ten thousand men after him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And
  the Lord discomfited Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the
  edge of the sword before Barac: and Sisara descended from off his chariot,
  and fled on his feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Barac
  pursued after the chariots and after the army, into Arisoth of the Gentiles;
  and the whole army of Sisara fell by the edge of the sword, there was not one
  left. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Sisara fled on his feet to
  the tent of Jael the wife of Chaber the Kenite his friend: for there was
  peace between Jabin king of Asor and the house of Chaber the Kenite.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jael went, out to meet Sisara,
  and said to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me, fear not: and he
  turned aside to her into the tent; and she covered him with a mantle.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Sisara said to her, Give me, I
  pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty: and she opened a bottle
  of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Sisara said to her, Stand now by the door of
  the tent, and it shall come to pass if any man come to thee, and ask of thee,
  and say, Is there any man here? then thou shalt say, There is not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Jael the wife of Chaber took a
  pin of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him, and
  fastened the pin in his temple, and it went through to the earth, and he
  fainted away, and darkness fell upon him and he died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And, behold, Barac was pursuing Sisara: and Jael
  went out to meet him, and he said to him, Come, and I will shew thee the man
  whom thou seekest: and he went in to her; and, behold, Sisara was fallen
  dead, and the pin was in his temple. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  So God routed Jabin king of Chanaan in that day before the children of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the hand of the children
  of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin king of Chanaan, until they
  utterly destroyed Jabin king of Chanaan.
  <h3 id="judges5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Debbora and
  Barac son of Abineem sang in that day, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> A revelation was made in Israel when the people
  were made willing: Praise ye the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Hear, ye kings, and hearken, rulers: I will sing, it is I who will sing to
  the Lord, it is I, I will sing a psalm to the Lord the god of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> O Lord, in thy going forth on Seir,
  when thou wentest forth out of the land of Edom, the earth quaked and the
  heaven dropped dews, and the clouds dropped water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The mountains were shaken before the face of the
  Lord Eloi, this Sina before the face of the Lord God of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> In the days of Samegar son of Anath, in the days
  of Jael, they deserted the ways, and went in by-ways; they went in crooked
  paths. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The mighty men in Israel
  failed, they failed until Debbora arose, until she arose a mother in Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They chose new gods; then the cities
  of rulers fought; there was not a shield or spear seen among forty thousand
  in Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> My heart inclines to the
  orders given in Israel; ye that are willing among the people, bless the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Ye that mount a she-ass at noon-day,
  ye that sit on the judgment-seat, and walk by the roads of them that sit in
  judgment by the way; declare <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> ye that
  are delivered from the noise of disturbers among the drawers of water; there
  shall they relate righteous acts: O Lord, increase righteous acts in Israel:
  then the people of the Lord went down to the cities. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Awake, awake, Debbora; awake, awake, utter a
  song: arise, Barac, and lead thy captivity captive, son of Abineem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then went down the remnant to the
  strong, the people of the Lord went down for him among the mighty ones from
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Ephraim rooted them out in
  Amalec, behind thee was Benjamin among thy people: the inhabitants of Machir
  came down with me searching out the enemy, and from Zabulon came they that
  draw with the scribe’s pen of record. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And princess in Issachar were with Debbora and Barac, thus she sent Barac on
  his feet in the valleys into the portions of Ruben; great pangs reached to
  the heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Why did they sit between
  the sheep-folds to hear the bleating of flocks for the divisions of Ruben?
  there were great searchings of heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  Galaad is on the other side of Jordan where he pitched his tents; and why
  does Dan remain in ships? Aser sat down on the sea-coasts, and he will
  tabernacle at his ports. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The people
  Zabulon exposed their soul to death, and Nephthali came to the high places of
  their land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Kings set themselves in
  array, then the kings of Chanaan fought in Thanaach at the water of Mageddo;
  they took no gift of money. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The stars
  from heaven set themselves in array, they set themselves to fight with Sisara
  out of their paths. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The brook of
  Kison swept them away, the ancient brook, the brook Kison: my mighty soul
  will trample him down. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> When the hoofs
  of the horse were entangled, his mighty ones earnestly hasted <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> to curse Meroz: Curse ye it, said the angel of
  the Lord; cursed is every one that dwells in it, because they came not to the
  help of the Lord, to his help among the mighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Blessed among women be Jael wife of Chaber the
  Kenite; let her be blessed above women in tents. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> He asked for water, she gave him milk in a dish;
  she brought butter of princes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> She
  stretched forth her left hand to the nail, and her right to the hand
  workman’s hammer, and she smote Sisara with it, she nailed through his head
  and smote him; she nailed through his temples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He rolled down between her feet; he fell and lay
  between her feet; he bowed and fell: where he bowed, there he fell dead.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The mother of Sisara looked down
  through the window out of the loophole, saying, Why was his chariot ashamed?
  why did the wheels of his chariots tarry? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Her wise ladies answered her, and she returned
  answers to herself, <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Will they not
  find him dividing the spoil? he will surely be gracious to every man: there
  are spoils of dyed garments for Sisara, spoils of various dyed garments, dyed
  embroidered garments, they are the spoils for his neck. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Thus let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: and
  they that love him shall be as the going forth of the sun in his strength.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the land had rest forty years.
  <h3 id="judges6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them
  into the hand of Madiam seven years <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And the hand of Madiam prevailed against Israel: and the children of Israel
  made for themselves because of Madiam the caves in the mountains, and the
  dens, and the holes in the rocks. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  it came to pass when the children of Israel sowed, that Madiam and Amalec
  went up, and the children of the east went up together with them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they encamped against them, and
  destroyed their fruits until they came to Gaza; and they left not the support
  of life in the land of Israel, not even ox or ass among the herds.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For they and their stock came up, and
  their tents were with them, as the locust in multitude, and there was no
  number to them and their camels; and they came to the land of Israel, and
  laid it waste. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Israel was greatly
  impoverished because of Madiam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  the children of Israel cried to the Lord because of Madiam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Lord sent a prophet to the children of
  Israel; and he said to them, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I am he that
  brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and I brought you up out of the
  house of your bondage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I delivered
  you out of the hand of Egypt, and out of the hand of all that afflicted you,
  and I cast them out before you; and I gave you their land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I said to you, I am the Lord your God: ye
  shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye
  hearkened not to my voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And an
  angel of the Lord came, and sat down under the fir tree, which was in
  Ephratha in the land of Joas father of Esdri; and Gedeon his son was
  threshing wheat in a wine-press in order to escape from the face of Madiam.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the angel of the Lord appeared to
  him and said to him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty in strength.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Gedeon said to him, Be gracious
  with me, my Lord: but if the Lord is with us, why have these evils found us?
  and where are all his miracles, which our fathers have related to us, saying,
  Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? and now he has cast us out, and
  given us into the hand of Madiam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  the angel of the Lord turned to him, and said, Go in this thy strength, and
  thou shalt save Israel out of the hand of Madiam: behold, I have sent thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Gedeon said to him, Be gracious
  with me, my Lord: whereby shall I save Israel? behold, my thousand is
  weakened in Manasse, and I am the least in my father’s house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the angel of the Lord said to him, The Lord
  shall be with thee, and thou shalt smite Madiam as one man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Gedeon said to him, If now I have found mercy
  in thine eyes, and thou wilt do this day for me all that thou hast spoken of
  with me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> depart not hence until I
  come to thee, and I will bring forth an offering and offer it before thee:
  and he said, I will remain until thou return. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Gedeon went in, and prepared a kid of the
  goats, and an ephah of fine flour unleavened; and he put the flesh in the
  basket, and poured the broth into the pot, and brought them forth to him
  under the turpentine tree, and drew nigh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh
  and the unleavened cakes, and put them on that rock, and pour out the broth
  close by: and he did so. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the
  angel of the Lord stretched out the end of the rod that was in his hand, and
  touched the flesh and the unleavened bread; and fire came up out of the rock,
  and consumed the flesh and the unleavened bread, and the angel of the Lord
  vanished from his sight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Gedeon
  saw that he was an angel of the Lord; and Gedeon said, Ah, ah, Lord my God!
  for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Lord said to him, Peace be to thee, fear
  not, thou shalt not die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Gedeon
  built there an altar to the Lord, and called it The peace of the Lord, until
  this day, as it is still in Ephratha of the father of Esdri. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And it came to pass in that night, that the Lord
  said to him, Take the young bullock which thy father has, even the second
  bullock of seven years old, and thou shalt destroy the altar of Baal which
  thy father has, and the grove which is by it thou shalt destroy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God
  on the top of this Maozi in the ordering it, and thou shalt take the second
  bullock, and shalt offer up whole-burnt-offerings with the wood of the grove,
  which thou shalt destroy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Gedeon
  took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord spoke to him: and it came
  to pass, as he feared the house of his father and the men of the city if he
  should do it by day, that he did it by night. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the men of the city rose up early in the
  morning; and behold, the altar of Baal had been demolished, and the grove by
  it had been destroyed; and they saw the second bullock, which Gedeon offered
  on the altar that had been built. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And
  a man said to his neighbour, Who has done this thing? and they enquired and
  searched, and learnt that Gedeon the son of Joas had done this thing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the men of the city said to Joas,
  Bring out thy son, and let him die, because he has destroyed the altar of
  Baal, and because he has destroyed the grove that is by it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Gedeon the son of Joas said to all the men
  who rose up against him, Do ye now plead for Baal, or will ye save him?
  whoever will plead for him, let him be slain this morning: if he be a god let
  him plead for himself, because one has thrown down his altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he called it in that day Jerobaal, saying,
  Let Baal plead thereby, because his altar has been thrown down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And all Madiam, and Amalek, and the sons of the
  east gathered themselves together, and encamped in the valley of Jezrael.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the Spirit of the Lord came upon
  Gedeon, and he blew with the horn, and Abiezer came to help after him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And Gedeon sent messengers into all
  Manasse, and into Aser, and into Zabulon, and into Nephthali; and he went up
  to meet them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And Gedeon said to God,
  If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> behold, I put the fleece of wool in the
  threshing-floor: if there be dew on the fleece only, and drought on all the
  ground, I shall know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast
  said. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And it was so: and he rose up
  early in the morning, and wrung the fleece, and dew dropped from the fleece,
  a bowl full of water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Gedeon said
  to God, Let not, I pray thee, thine anger be kindled with me, and I will
  speak yet once; I will even yet make one trial more with the fleece: let now
  the drought be upon the fleece only, and let there be dew on all the ground.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And God did so in that night; and
  there was drought on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.
  <h3 id="judges7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jerobaal
  rose early, the same is Gedeon, and all the people with him, and encamped at
  the fountain of Arad; and the camp of Madiam was to the north of him,
  reaching from Gabaathamorai, in the valley. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord said to Gedeon, The people with thee
  are many, so that I may not deliver Madiam into their hand, lest at any time
  Israel boast against me, saying, My hand has saved me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And now speak in the ears of the people, saying,
  Who is afraid and fearful? let him turn and depart from mount Galaad: and
  there returned of the people twenty-two thousand, and ten thousand were left.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord said to Gedeon, The
  people is yet numerous; bring them down to the water, and I will purge them
  there for thee: and it shall come to pass that of whomsoever I shall say to
  thee, This one shall go with thee, even he shall go with thee; and of
  whomsoever I shall say to thee, This one shall not go with thee, even he
  shall not go with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he brought
  the people down to the water; and the Lord said to Gedeon, Whosoever shall
  lap of the water with his tongue as if a dog should lap, thou shalt set him
  apart, and also whosoever shall bow down upon his knees to drink.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the number of those that lapped
  with their hand to their mouth was three hundred men; and all the rest of the
  people bowed upon their knees to drink water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the Lord said to Gedeon, I will save you by
  the three hundred men that lapped, and I will give Madiam into thy hand; and
  all the rest of the people shall go every one to his place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they took the provision of the people in their
  hand, and their horns; and he sent away every man of Israel each to his tent,
  and he strengthened the three hundred; and the army of Madiam were beneath
  him in the valley. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And it came to pass
  in that night that the Lord said to him, Arise, go down into the camp, for I
  have delivered it into thy hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  if thou art afraid to go down, go down thou and thy servant Phara into the
  camp. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou shalt hear what they
  shall say, and afterwards thy hands shall be strong, and thou shalt go down
  into the camp: and he went down and Phara his servant to the extremity of the
  companies of fifty, which were in the camp. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Madiam and Amalec and all the children of the
  east were scattered in the valley, as the locust for multitude; and there was
  no number to their camels, but they were as the sand on the seashore for
  multitude. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Gedeon came, and
  behold a man was relating to his neighbour a dream, and he said, Behold, I
  have dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread rolling into the
  camp of Madiam, and it came as far as a tent, and smote it, and it fell, and
  it turned it up, and the tent fell. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And his neighbour answered and said, This is none other than the sword of
  Gedeon, son of Joas, a man of Israel: God has delivered Madiam and all the
  host into his hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it came to
  pass when Gedeon heard the account of the dream and the interpretation of it,
  that he worshipped the Lord, and returned to the camp of Israel, and said,
  Rise, for the Lord has delivered the camp of Madiam into our hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he divided the three hundred men
  into three companies, and put horns in the hands of all, and empty pitchers,
  and torches in the pitchers: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and he
  said to them, Ye shall look at me, and so shall ye do; and behold, I will go
  into the beginning of the host, and it shall come to pass that as I do, so
  shall ye do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I will sound with
  the horn, and all ye with me shall sound with the horn round about the whole
  camp, and ye shall say, For the Lord and Gedeon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Gedeon and the hundred men that were with him
  came to the extremity of the army in the beginning of the middle watch; and
  they completely roused the guards, and sounded with the horns, and they broke
  the pitchers that were in their hands, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and the three companies sounded with the horns,
  and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and in
  their right hands their horns to sound with; and they cried out, A sword for
  the Lord and for Gedeon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And every
  man stood in his place round about the host; and all the host ran, and
  sounded an alarm, and fled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they
  sounded with the three hundred horns; and the Lord set every man’s sword in
  all the host against his neighbour. (<span style="color:#b00e23">23</span>)
  And the host fled as far as Bethseed Tagaragatha Abel-meula to Tabath; and
  the men of Israel from Nephthali, and from Aser, and from all Manasse, came
  to help, and followed after Madiam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And Gedeon sent messengers into all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down to meet
  Madiam, and take to yourselves the water as far as Baethera and Jordan: and
  every man of Ephraim cried out, and they took the water before hand unto
  Baethera and Jordan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they took
  the princess of Madiam, even Oreb and Zeb; and they slew Oreb in Sur Oreb,
  and they slew Zeb in Jakephzeph; and they pursued Madiam, and brought the
  heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon from beyond Jordan.
  <h3 id="judges8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the men of
  Ephraim said to Gedeon, What is this that thou hast done to us, in that thou
  didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Madiam? and they chode with
  him sharply. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said to them, What
  have I now done in comparison of you? is not the gleaning of Ephraim better
  than the vintage of Abiezer? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The Lord
  has delivered into your hand the princes of Madiam, Oreb and Zeb; and what
  could I do in comparison of you? Then was their spirit calmed toward him,
  when he spoke this word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Gedeon
  came to Jordan, and went over, himself and the three hundred with him,
  hungry, yet pursuing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he said to
  the men of Socchoth, Give, I pray you, bread to feed this people that follow
  me; because they are faint, and behold, I am following after Zebee and
  Salmana, kings of Madiam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the
  princes of Socchoth said, Are the hands of Zebee and Salmana now in thy hand,
  that we should give bread to thy host? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And Gedeon said, Therefore when the Lord gives Zebee and Salmana into my
  hand, then will I tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness, and the
  Barkenim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he went up thence to
  Phanuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Phanuel answered him as
  the men of Socchoth had answered him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And Gedeon said to the men of Phanuel, When I return in peace, I will break
  down this tower. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Zebee and
  Salmana were in Carcar, and their host was with them, about fifteen thousand,
  all that were left of all the host of the aliens; and they that fell were a
  hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt
  in tents, eastward of Nabai and Jegebal; and he smote the host, and the host
  was secure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Zebee and Salmana
  fled; and he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Madiam, Zebee and
  Salmana, and discomfited all the army. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Gedeon the son of Joas returned from the
  battle, down from the battle of Ares. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And he took prisoner a young lad of the men of Socchoth, and questioned him;
  and he wrote to him the names of the princes of Socchoth and of their elders,
  seventy-seven men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Gedeon came to
  the princes of Socchoth, and said, Behold Zebee and Salmana, about whom ye
  reproached me, saying, Are the hands of Zebee and Salmana now in thy hand,
  that we should give bread to thy men that are faint? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he took the elders of the city with the
  thorns of the wilderness and the Barkenim, and with them he tore the men of
  the city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he overthrew the tower
  of Phanuel, and slew the men of the city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he said to Zebee and Salmana, Where are the
  men whom ye slew in Thabor? and they said, As thou, so were they, according
  to the likeness of the son of a king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And Gedeon said, They were my brethren and the sons of my mother: as the Lord
  lives, if ye had preserved them alive, I would not have slain you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he said to Jether his first-born,
  Rise and slay them; but the lad drew not his sword, for he was afraid, for he
  was yet very young. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Zebee and
  Salmana said, Rise thou and fall upon us, for thy power is as that of a man;
  and Gedeon arose, and slew Zebee and Salmana: and he took the round ornaments
  that were on the necks of their camels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the men of Israel said to Gedeon, Rule, my
  lord, over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son; for thou hast saved
  us out of the hand of Madiam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  Gedeon said to them, I will not rule, and my son shall not rule among you;
  the Lord shall rule over you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  Gedeon said to them, I will make a request of you, and do ye give me every
  man an earring out of his spoils: for they had golden earrings, for they were
  Ismaelites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they said, We will
  certainly give them: and he opened his garment, and each man cast therein an
  earring of his spoils. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the weight
  of the golden earrings which he asked, was a thousand and seven hundred
  pieces of gold, besides the crescents, and the chains, and the garments, and
  the purple cloths that were on the kings of Madiam, and besides the chains
  that were on the necks of their camels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Gedeon made an ephod of it, an set it in his
  city in Ephratha; and all Israel went thither a whoring after it, and it
  became a stumbling-block to Gedeon and his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Madiam, was straitened before the children of
  Israel, and they did not lift up their head any more; and the land had rest
  forty years in the days of Gedeon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  And Jerobaal the son of Joas went and sat in his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Gedeon had seventy sons begotten of his body,
  for he had many wives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And his
  concubine was in Sychem, and she also bore him a son, and gave him the name
  Abimelech. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Gedeon son of Joas
  died in his city, and he was buried in the sepulchre of Joas his father in
  Ephratha of Abi-Esdri. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And it came to
  pass when Gedeon was dead, that the children of Israel turned, and went a
  whoring after Baalim, and made for themselves a covenant with Baal that he
  should be their god. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the children
  of Israel remembered not the Lord their God who had delivered them out of the
  hand of all that afflicted them round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And they did not deal mercifully with the house
  of Jerobaal, (the same is Gedeon) according to all the good which he did to
  Israel.
  <h3 id="judges9">9</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Abimelech
  son of Jerobaal went to Sychem to his mother’s brethren; and he spoke to them
  and to all the kindred of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all
  the men of Sychem, saying, Which is better for you, that seventy men, even
  all the sons of Jerobaal, should reign over you, or that one man should reign
  over you? and remember that I am your bone and your flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And his mother’s brethren spoke concerning him in
  the ears of all the men of Sychem all these words; and their heart turned
  after Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of
  the house of Baalberith; and Abimelech hired for himself vain and cowardly
  men, and they went after him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he
  went to the house of his father to Ephratha, and slew his brethren the sons
  of Jerobaal, seventy men upon one stone; but Joatham the youngest son of
  Jerobaal was left, for he hid himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And all the men of Sicima, and all the house of Bethmaalo, were gathered
  together, and they went and made Abimelech king by the oak of Sedition, which
  was at Sicima. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it was reported to
  Joatham, and he went and stood on the top of mount Garizin, and lifted up his
  voice, and wept, and said to them, Hear me, ye men of Sicima, and God shall
  hear you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The trees went forth on a
  time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive, Reign over us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But the olives said to them, Shall I
  leave my fatness, with which men shall glorify God, and go to be promoted
  over the trees? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the trees said to
  the fig-tree, Come, reign over us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  But the fig-tree said to them, Shall I leave my sweetness an my good fruits,
  and go to be promoted over the trees? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And the trees said to the vine, Come, reign over us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the vine said to them, Shall I leave my wine
  that cheers God and men, and go to be promoted over the trees? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then all the trees said to the bramble, Come thou
  and reign over us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the bramble
  said to the trees, If ye in truth anoint me to reign over you, come, stand
  under my shadow; and if not, let fire come out from me and devour the cedars
  of Libanus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And now, if ye have done
  it in truth and integrity, and have made Abimelech king, and if ye have
  wrought well with Jerobaal, and with his house, and if ye have done to him
  according to the reward of his hand, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  as my father fought for you, and put his life in jeopardy, and delivered you
  out of the hand of Madiam; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and ye are
  risen up this day against the house of my father, and have slain his sons,
  being seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech the son of his
  bondwoman king over the men of Sicima, because he is your brother:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> if then ye have done truly and
  faithfully with Jerobaal, and with his house this day, rejoice ye in
  Abimelech, and let him also rejoice over you: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and
  devour the men of Sicima, and the house of Bethmaalo; and let fire come out
  from the men of Sicima and from the house of Bethmaalo, and devour Abimelech.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Joatham fled, and ran away, and
  went as far as Baeer, and dwelt there out of the way of his brother
  Abimelech. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Abimelech reigned over
  Israel three years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And God sent an
  evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Sicima; and the men of Sicima
  dealt treacherously with the house of Abimelech: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> to bring the injury done to the seventy sons of
  Jerobaal, and to lay their blood upon their brother Abimelech, who slew them,
  and upon the men of Sicima, because they strengthened his hands to slay his
  brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the men of Sicima set
  liers in wait against him on the top of the mountains, and robbed every one
  who passed by them on the way; and it was reported to the king Abimelech.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Gaal son of Jobel came, and his
  brethren, and passed by Sicima, and the men of Sicima trusted in him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they went out into the field, and
  gathered their grapes, and trod them, and made merry; and they brought the
  grapes into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Gaal the son of Jobel said, Who
  is Abimelech, and who is the son of Sychem, that we should serve him? Is he
  not the son of Jerobaal, and is not Zebul his steward, his servant with the
  son of Emmor the father of Sychem? and why should we serve him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And would that this people were under my hand!
  then would I remove Abimelech, and I would say to him, Multiply thy host, and
  come out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Zebul the ruler of the
  city heard the words of Gaal the son of Jobel, and he was very angry.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he sent messengers to Abimelech
  secretly, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Jobel and his brethren are come to
  Sychem; and behold, they have besieged the city against thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And now rise up by night, thou and the people
  with thee, and lay wait in the field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  And it shall come to pass in the morning at sunrising, thou shalt rise up
  early and draw toward the city; and behold, he and the people with him will
  come forth against thee, and thou shalt do to him according to thy power.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Abimelech and all the people with
  him rose up by night, and formed an ambuscade against Sychem in four
  companies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And Gaal the son of Jobel
  went forth, and stood by the door of the gate of the city: and Abimelech and
  the people with him rose up from the ambuscade. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And Gaal the son of Jobel saw the people, and
  said to Zebul, Behold, a people comes down from the top of the mountains: and
  Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And Gaal continued to speak and said,
  Behold, a people comes down westward from the part bordering on the middle of
  the land, and another company comes by the way of Helon Maonenim.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Zebul said to him, And where is
  thy mouth as thou spokest, Who is Abimelech that we should serve him? Is not
  this the people whom thou despisedst? go forth now, and set the battle in
  array against him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Gaal went
  forth before the men of Sychem, and set the battle in array against
  Abimelech. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And Abimelech pursued him,
  and he fled from before him; and many fell down slain as far as the door of
  the gate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And Abimelech entered into
  Arema, and Zebul cast out Gaal and his brethren, so that they should not
  dwell in Sychem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And it came to pass
  on the second day that the people went out into the field, and one brought
  word to Abimelech. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And he took the
  people, and divided them into three companies, and formed an ambush in the
  field; and he looked, and, behold, the people went forth out of the city, and
  he rose up against them, and smote them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And Abimelech and the chiefs of companies that
  were with him rushed forward, and stood by the door of the gate of the city;
  and the two other companies rushed forward upon all that were in the field,
  and smote them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And Abimelech fought
  against the city all that day, and took the city, and slew the people that
  were in it, and destroyed the city, and sowed it with salt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And all the men of the tower of Sychem heard, and
  came to the gathering of Baethel-berith. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And it was reported to Abimelech, that all the
  men of the tower of Sychem were gathered together. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And Abimelech went up to the mount of Selmon, and
  all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and
  cut down a branch of a tree, and took it, and laid it on his shoulders; and
  said to the people that were with him, What ye see me doing, do quickly as I.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And they cut down likewise even every
  man a branch, and went after Abimelech, and laid them against the place of
  gathering, and burnt the place of gathering over them with fire; and they
  died, even all the men of the tower of Sicima, about a thousand men and
  women. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And Abimelech went out of
  Baethel-berith, and encamped against Thebes, and took it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And there was a strong tower in the midst of the
  city; and thither all the men and the women of the city fled, and shut the
  door without them, and went up on the roof of the tower. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And Abimelech drew near to the tower, and they
  besieged it; and Abimelech drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with
  fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And a woman cast a piece of a
  millstone upon the head of Abimelech, and broke his skull. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And he cried out quickly to the young man his
  armour-bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, lest at any time
  they should say, A woman slew him: and his young man thrust him through and
  he died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And the men of Israel saw
  that Abimelech was dead; and they went each to his place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(56)</span> So God requited the wickedness of Abimelech,
  which he wrought against his father, in slaying his seventy brethren.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And all the wickedness of the men of
  Sychem God requited upon their head; and the curse of Joatham the son of
  Jerobaal came upon them.
  <h3 id="judges10">10</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And after
  Abimelech Thola the son of Phua rose up to save Israel, being the son of his
  father’s brother, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Samir in mount Ephraim.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he judged Israel twenty-three
  years, and died, and was buried in Samir. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And after him arose Jair of Galaad, and he judged
  Israel twenty-two years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he had
  thirty-two sons riding on thirty-two colts, and they had thirty-two cities;
  and they called them Jair’s towns until this day in the land of Galaad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Jair died, and was buried in
  Rhamnon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the children of Israel
  did evil again in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim, and Astaroth, and
  the gods of Aram, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods
  of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Phylistines; and they forsook
  the Lord, and did not serve him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  the Lord was very angry with Israel, and sold them into the hands of the
  Phylistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they afflicted and bruised the children of
  Israel at that time eighteen years, all the children of Israel beyond Jordan
  in the land of the Amorite in Galaad. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And the children of Ammon went over Jordan to fight with Juda, and Benjamin,
  and with Ephraim; and the children of Israel were greatly afflicted.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the children of Israel cried to
  the Lord, saying, We have sinned against thee, because we have forsaken God,
  and served Baalim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Lord said
  to the children of Israel, Did I not save you from Egypt and from the
  Amorite, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Phylistines,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and from the Sidonians, and Amalec,
  and Madiam, who afflicted you? and ye cried to me, and I saved you out of
  their hand? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Yet ye forsook me and
  served other gods; therefore I will not save you any more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Go, and cry to the gods whom ye have chosen to
  yourselves, and let them save you in the time of your affliction.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the children of Israel said to
  the Lord, We have sinned: do thou to us according to all that is good in
  thine eyes; only deliver us this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And they put away the strange gods from the midst of them, and served the
  Lord only, and his soul was pained for the trouble of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the children of Ammon went up, and encamped
  in Galaad; and the children of Israel were gathered together and encamped on
  the hill. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the people the princes
  of Galaad said every man to his neighbour, Who is he that shall begin to
  fight against the children of Ammon? he shall even be head over all that
  dwell in Galaad.
  <h3 id="judges11">11</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jephthae
  the Galaadite was a mighty man; and he was the son of a harlot, who bore
  Jephthae to Galaad. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the wife of
  Galaad bore him sons; and the sons of his wife grew up, and they cast out
  Jephthae, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in the house of our father,
  for thou art the son of a concubine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And Jephthae fled from the face of his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
  Tob; and vain men gathered to Jephthae, and went out with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And it came to pass when the children of Ammon
  prepared to fight with Israel, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> that
  the elders of Galaad went to fetch Jephthae from the land of Tob.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they said to Jephthae, Come, and
  be our head, and we will fight with the sons of Ammon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Jephthae said to the elders of Galaad, Did ye
  not hate me, and cast me out of my father’s house, and banish me from you?
  and wherefore are ye come to me now when ye want me? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the elders of Galaad said to Jephthae,
  Therefore have we now turned to thee, that thou shouldest go with us, and
  fight against the sons of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of
  Galaad. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Jephthae said to the
  elders of Galaad, If ye turn me back to fight with the children of Ammon, and
  the Lord should deliver them before me, then will I be your head.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the elders of Galaad said to
  Jephthae, The Lord be witness between us, if we shall not do according to thy
  word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Jephthae went with the
  elders of Galaad, and the people made him head and ruler over them: and
  Jephthae spoke all his words before the Lord in Massepha. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Jephthae sent messengers to the king of the
  children of Ammon, saying, What have I to do with thee, that thou hast come
  against me to fight in my land? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  the king of the children of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthae, Because
  Israel took my land when he went up out of Egypt, from Arnon to Jaboc, and to
  Jordan: now then return them peaceably and I will depart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Jephthae again sent messengers to the king of
  the children of Ammon, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and said to
  him, Thus says Jephthae, Israel took not the land of Moab, nor the land of
  the children of Ammon; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> for in their
  going up out of Egypt Israel went in the wilderness as far as the sea of
  Siph, and came to Cades. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Israel
  sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, I will pass, if it please thee,
  by thy land: and the king of Edom complied not: and Israel also sent to the
  king of Moab, and he did not consent; and Israel sojourned in Cades.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they journeyed in the wilderness,
  and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab: and they came by the
  east of the land of Moab, an encamped in the country beyond Arnon, and came
  not within the borders of Moab, for Arnon is the border of Moab. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Israel sent messengers to Seon king of the
  Amorite, king of Esbon, and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, by
  thy land to our place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Seon did
  not trust Israel to pass by his coast; and Seon gathered all his people, and
  they encamped at Jasa; and he set the battle in array against Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Lord God of Israel delivered
  Seon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote him; and
  Israel inherited all the land of the Amorite who dwelt in that land,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> from Arnon and to Jaboc, and from the
  wilderness to Jordan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And now the
  Lord God of Israel has removed the Amorite from before his people Israel, and
  shalt thou inherit his land? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Wilt
  thou not inherit those possessions which Chamos thy god shall cause thee to
  inherit; and shall not we inherit the land of all those whom the Lord our God
  has removed from before you? <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And now
  art thou any better than Balac son of Sepphor, king of Moab? did he indeed
  fight with Israel, or indeed make war with him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> when Israel dwelt in Esebon and in its coasts,
  and in the land of Aroer and in its coasts, and in all the cities by Jordan,
  three hundred years? and wherefore didst thou not recover them in that time?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And now I have not sinned against
  thee, but thou wrongest me in preparing war against me: may the Lord the
  Judge judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of
  Ammon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But the king of the children
  of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthae, which he sent to him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And the spirit of the Lord came upon
  Jephthae, and he passed over Galaad, and Manasse, and passed by the
  watch-tower of Galaad to the other side of the children of Ammon.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Jephthae vowed a vow to the Lord,
  and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> then it shall come to pass that
  whosoever shall first come out of the door of my house to meet me when I
  return in peace from the children of Ammon, he shall be the Lord’s: I will
  offer him up for a whole-burnt-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Jephthae advanced to meet the sons of Ammon
  to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he smote them from Aroer till one
  comes to Arnon, in number twenty cities, and as far as Ebelcharmim, with a
  very great destruction: and the children of Ammon were straitened before the
  children of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Jephthae came
  to Massepha to his house; and behold, his daughter came forth to meet him
  with timbrels and dances; and she was his only child, he had not another son
  or daughter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And it came to pass when
  he saw her, that he rent his garments, and said, Ah, ah, my daughter, thou
  hast indeed troubled me, and thou wast the cause of my trouble; and I have
  opened my mouth against thee to the Lord, and I shall not be able to return
  from it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And she said to him, Father,
  hast thou opened thy mouth to the Lord? Do to me accordingly as the word went
  out of thy mouth, in that the Lord has wrought vengeance for thee on thine
  enemies of the children of Ammon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And
  she said to her father, Let my father now do this thing: let me alone for two
  months, and I will go up and down on the mountains, and I will bewail my
  virginity, I and my companions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And
  he said, Go: and he sent her away for two months; and she went, and her
  companions, and she bewailed her virginity on the mountains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And it came to pass at the end of the two months
  that she returned to her father; and he performed upon her his vow which he
  vowed; and she knew no man: <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> and it
  was an ordinance in Israel, That the daughters of Israel went from year to
  year to bewail the daughter of Jephthae the Galaadite for four days in a
  year.
  <h3 id="judges12">12</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the men
  of Ephraim assembled themselves, and passed on to the north, and said to
  Jephthae, Wherefore didst thou go over to fight with the children of Ammon,
  and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house over thee with
  fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Jephthae said to them, I and
  my people and the children of Ammon were very much engaged in war; and I
  called for you, and ye did not save me out of their hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I saw that thou wert no helper, and I put my
  life in my hand, and passed on to the sons of Ammon; and the Lord delivered
  them into my hand: and wherefore are ye come up against me this day to fight
  with me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jephthae gathered all the
  men of Galaad, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Galaad smote Ephraim,
  because they that were escaped of Ephraim said, Ye are of Galaad in the midst
  of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasse. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Galaad took the fords of Jordan before
  Ephraim; and they that escaped of Ephraim said to them, Let us go over: and
  the men of Galaad said, Art thou an Ephrathite? and he said, No. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Then they said to him, Say now Stachys; and he did
  not rightly pronounce it so: and they took him, and slew him at the fords of
  Jordan; and there fell at that time of Ephraim two and forty thousand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Jephthae judged Israel six years;
  and Jephthae the Galaadite died, and was buried in his city Galaad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And after him Abaissan of Bethleem
  judged Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he had thirty sons,
  and thirty daughters, whom he sent forth; and he brought in thirty daughters
  for his sons from without; and he judged Israel seven years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Abaissan died, and was buried in Bethleem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And after him Ælom of Zabulon judged
  Israel ten years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Ælom of Zabulon
  died, and was buried in Ælom in the land of Zabulon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And after him Abdon the son of Ellel, the
  Pharathonite, judged Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he
  had forty sons, and thirty grandsons, that rode upon seventy colts: and he
  judged Israel eight years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Abdon
  the son of Ellel, the Pharathonite, died, and was buried in Pharathon in the
  land of Ephraim in the mount of Amalec.
  <h3 id="judges13">13</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  children of Israel yet again committed iniquity before the Lord; and the Lord
  delivered them into the hand of the Phylistines forty years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And there was a man of Saraa, of the family of the
  kindred of Dan, and his name was Manoe, and his wife was barren, and bore
  not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And an angel of the Lord appeared
  to the woman, and said to her, Behold, thou art barren and hast not born; yet
  thou shalt conceive a son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And now be
  very cautious, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat no unclean thing;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> for behold, thou art with child, and
  shalt bring forth a son; and there shall come no razor upon his head, for the
  child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to save
  Israel from the hand of the Phylistines. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the woman went in, and spoke to her husband,
  saying, A man of God came to me, and his appearance was as of an angel of
  God, very dreadful; and I did not ask him whence he was, and he did not tell
  me his name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he said to me,
  Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bring forth a son; and now drink no
  wine nor strong drink, and eat no unclean thing; for the child shall be holy
  to God from the womb until the day of his death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Manoe prayed to the Lord and said, I pray
  thee, O Lord my lord, concerning the man of God whom thou sentest; let him
  now come to us once more, and teach us what we shall do to the child about to
  be born. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord heard the voice
  of Manoe, and the angel of God came yet again to the woman; and she sat in
  the field, and Manoe her husband was not with her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the woman hasted, and ran, and brought word
  to her husband, and said to him, Behold the man who came in the other day to
  me has appeared to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Manoe
  arose and followed his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou
  the man that spoke to the woman? and the angel said, I am. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Manoe said, Now shall thy word come to pass:
  what shall be the ordering of the child, and our dealings with him?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the angel of the Lord said to
  Manoe, Of all things concerning which I spoke to the woman, she shall beware.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> She shall eat of nothing that comes
  of the vine yielding wine, and let her not drink wine or strong liquor, and
  let her not eat anything unclean: all things that I have charged her she
  shall observe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Manoe said to the
  angel of the Lord, Let us detain thee here, and prepare before thee a kid of
  the goats. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the angel of the Lord
  said to Manoe, If thou shouldest detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and
  if thou wouldest offer a whole-burnt-offering, to the Lord thou shalt offer
  it: for Manoe knew not that he was an angel of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Manoe said to the angel of the Lord, What is
  thy name, that when thy word shall come to pass, we may glorify thee?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the angel of the Lord said to
  him, Why dost thou thus ask after my name; whereas it is wonderful?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Manoe took a kid of the goats and
  its meat-offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord; and the angel
  wrought a distinct work, and Manoe and his wife were looking on. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And it came to pass when the flame went up above
  the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the Lord went up in the flame; and
  Manoe and his wife were looking, and they fell upon their face to the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the angel appeared no more to
  Manoe and to his wife: then Manoe knew that this was an angel of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Manoe said to his wife, We shall
  surely die, because we have seen God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  But his wife said to him, If the Lord were pleased to slay us, he would not
  have received of our hand a whole-burnt-offering and a meat-offering; and he
  would not have shewn us all these things, neither would he have caused us to
  hear all these things as at this time. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the woman brought forth a son, and she called
  his name Sampson; and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the Spirit of the Lord began to go out with
  him in the camp of Dan, and between Saraa and Esthaol.
  <h3 id="judges14">14</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Sampson
  went down to Thamnatha, and saw a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the
  Philistines. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he went up and told
  his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Thamnatha of the
  daughters of the Phylistines; and now take her to me for a wife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And his father and his mother said to him, Are
  there no daughters of thy brethren, and is there not a woman of all my
  people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And
  Sampson said to his father, Take her for me, for she is right in my eyes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And his father and his mother knew not
  that it was of the Lord, that he sought to be revenged on the Philistines:
  and at that time the Philistines lorded it over Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Sampson and his father and his mother went
  down to Thamnatha, and he came to the vineyard of Thamnatha; and behold, a
  young lion roared in meeting him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him, and he crushed him as he
  would have crushed a kid of the goats, and there was nothing in his hands:
  and he told not his father and his mother what he had done. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they went down and spoke to the woman, and she
  was pleasing in the eyes of Sampson. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And after some time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the
  carcase of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees, and honey were in the mouth
  of the lion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he took it into his
  hands, and went on eating, and he went to his father and his mother, and gave
  to them, and they did eat; but he told them not that he took the honey out of
  the mouth of the lion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And his father
  went down to the woman, and Sampson made there a banquet for seven days, for
  so the young men are used to do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  it came to pass when they saw him, that they took thirty guests, and they
  were with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Sampson said to
  them, I propound you a riddle: if ye will indeed tell it me, and discover it
  within the seven days of the feast, I will you give thirty sheets and thirty
  changes of raiment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if ye cannot
  tell it me, ye shall give me thirty napkins and thirty changes of apparel:
  and they said to him, Propound thy riddle, and we will hear it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he said to them, Meat came forth of the
  eater, and sweetness out of the strong: and they could not tell the riddle
  for three days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it came to pass
  on the fourth day, that they said to the wife of Sampson, Deceive now thy
  husband, and let him tell thee the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s
  house with fire: did ye invite us to do us violence? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Sampson’s wife wept before him, and said,
  Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not; for the riddle which thou hast
  propounded to the children of my people thou hast not told me: and Sampson
  said to her, If I have not told it to my father and my mother, shall I tell
  it to thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And she wept before him
  the seven days, during which their banquet lasted: and it came to pass on the
  seventh day, that he told her, because she troubled him; and she told it to
  the children of her people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the
  men of the city said to him on the seventh day, before sunrise, What is
  sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? and Sampson said to
  them, If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, ye would not have known my
  riddle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the Spirit of the Lord
  came upon him powerfully, and he went down to Ascalon, and destroyed of the
  inhabitants thirty men, and took their garments, and gave the changes of
  raiment to them that told the riddle; and Sampson was very angry, and went up
  to the house of his father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the
  wife of Sampson was given to one of his friends, with whom he was on terms of
  friendship.
  <h3 id="judges15">15</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came
  to pass after a time, in the days of wheat harvest, that Sampson visited his
  wife with a kid, and said, I will go in to my wife even into the chamber: but
  her father did not suffer him to go in. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And her father spoke, saying, I said that thou
  didst surely hate her, and I gave her to one of thy friends: is not her
  younger sister better than she? let her be to thee instead of her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Sampson said to them, Even for
  once am I guiltless with regard to the Philistines, in that I do mischief
  among them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Sampson went and
  caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and
  put a torch between two tails, and fastened it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he set fire to the torches, and sent the foxes
  into the corn of the Philistines; and every thing was burnt from the
  threshing floor to the standing corn, and even to the vineyard and olives.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Philistines said, Who has done
  these things? and they said, Sampson the son-in-law of the Thamnite, because
  he has taken his wife, and given her to one of his friends; and the
  Philistines went up, and burnt her and her father’s house with fire.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Sampson said to them, Though ye
  may have dealt thus with her, verily I will be avenged of you, and afterwards
  I will cease. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he smote them leg on
  thigh with a great overthrow; and went down and dwelt in a cave of the rock
  Etam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Philistines went up, and
  encamped in Juda, and spread themselves abroad in Lechi. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the men of Juda said, Why are ye come up
  against us? and the Philistines said, We are come up to bind Sampson, and to
  do to him as he has done to us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  the three thousand men of Juda went down to the hole of the rock Etam, and
  they said to Sampson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? and
  what is this that thou hast done to us? and Sampson said to them, As they did
  to me, so have I done to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  they said to him, We are come down to bind thee to deliver thee into the hand
  of the Philistines: and Sampson said to them, Swear to me that ye will not
  fall upon me yourselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they
  spoke to him, saying, Nay, but we will only bind thee fast, and deliver thee
  into their hand, and will by no means slay thee: and they bound him with two
  new ropes, and brought him from that rock. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they came to Lechi: and the Philistines
  shouted, and ran to meet him: and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
  him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as tow which is burnt with
  fire; and his bonds were consumed from off his hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he found the jaw-bone of an ass that had been
  cast away, and he put forth his hand and took it, and smote with it a
  thousand men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Sampson said, With
  the jaw-bone of an ass I have utterly destroyed them, for with the jaw-bone
  of an ass I have smitten a thousand men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it came to pass when he ceased speaking, that
  he cast the jaw-bone out of his hand; and he called that place the Lifting of
  the jaw-bone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he was very
  thirsty, and wept before the Lord, and said, Thou hast been well pleased to
  grant this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant, and new shall I die
  for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And God broke open a hollow place in the jaw, and
  there came thence water, and he drank; and his spirit returned and he
  revived: therefore the name of the fountain was called ‘The well of the
  invoker,’ which is in Lechi, until this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he judged Israel in the days of the
  Philistines twenty years.
  <h3 id="judges16">16</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Sampson
  went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And it was reported to the Gazites, saying,
  Sampson is come hither: and they compassed him and laid wait for him all
  night in the gate of the city, and they were quiet all the night, saying, Let
  us wait till the dawn appear, and we will slay him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Sampson slept till midnight, and rose up at
  midnight, and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city with the two
  posts, and lifted them up with the bar, and laid them on his shoulders, and
  he went up to the top of the mountain that is before Chebron, and laid them
  there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And it came to pass after this
  that he loved a woman in Alsorech, and her name was Dalida. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the princess of the Philistines came up to
  her, and said to her, Beguile him, and see wherein his great strength is, and
  wherewith we shall prevail against him, and bind him to humble him; and we
  will give thee each eleven hundred pieces of silver. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Dalida said to Sampson, Tell me, I pray thee,
  wherein is thy great strength, and wherewith thou shalt be bound that thou
  mayest be humbled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Sampson said to
  her, If they bind me with seven moist cords that have not been spoiled, then
  shall I be weak and be as one of ordinary men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the princess of the Philistines brought to her
  seven moist cords that had not been spoiled, and she bound him with them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the liers in wait remained with
  her in the chamber; and she said to him, the Philistines are upon thee,
  Sampson: and he broke the cords as if any one should break a thread of tow
  when it has touched the fire, and his strength was not known. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Dalida said to Sampson, Behold, thou hast
  cheated me, and told me lies; now then tell me wherewith thou shalt be bound.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he said to her, If they should
  bind me fast with new ropes with which work has not been done, then shall I
  be weak, and shall be as another man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And Dalida took new ropes, and bound him with them, and the liers in wait
  came out of the chamber, and she said, The Philistines are upon thee,
  Sampson: and he broke them off his arms like a thread. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Dalida said to Sampson, Behold, thou hast
  deceived me, and told me lies; tell me, I intreat thee, wherewith thou mayest
  be bound: and he said to her, If thou shouldest weave the seven locks of my
  head with the web, and shouldest fasten them with the pin into the wall, then
  shall I be weak as another man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  it came to pass when he was asleep, that Dalida took the seven locks of his
  head, and wove them with the web, and fastened them with the pin into the
  wall, and she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Sampson: and he awoke out
  of his sleep, and carried away the pin of the web out of the wall.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Dalida said to Sampson, How
  sayest thou, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? this third time thou
  hast deceived me, and hast not told me wherein is thy great strength.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And it came to pass as she pressed
  him sore with her words continually, and straitened him, that his spirit
  failed almost to death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Then he told
  her all his heart, and said to her, A razor has not come upon my head,
  because I have been a holy one of God from my mother’s womb; if then I should
  be shaven, my strength will depart from me, and I shall be weak, and I shall
  be as all other men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Dalida saw
  that he told her all his heart, and she sent and called the princess of the
  Philistines, saying, Come up yet this once; for he has told me all his heart.
  And the chiefs of the Philistines went up to her, and brought the money in
  their hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Dalida made Sampson
  sleep upon her knees; and she called a man, and he shaved the seven locks of
  his head, and she began to humble him, and his strength departed from him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Dalida said, The Philistines are
  upon thee, Sampson: and he awoke out of his sleep and said, I will go out as
  at former times, and shake myself; and he knew not that the Lord was departed
  from him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Philistines took
  him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with
  fetters of brass; and he ground in the prison-house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the hair of his head began to grow as before
  it was shaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the chiefs of the
  Philistines met to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon, and to make
  merry; and they said, God has given into our hand our enemy Sampson.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the people saw him, and sang
  praises to their god; for our god, said they, has delivered into our hand our
  enemy, who wasted our land, and who multiplied our slain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And when their heart was merry, then they said,
  Call Sampson out of the prison-house, and let him play before us: and they
  called Sampson out of the prison-house, and he played before them; and they
  smote him with the palms of their hands, and set him between the pillars.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Sampson said to the young man
  that held his hand, Suffer me to feel the pillars on which the house rests,
  and I will stay myself upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And
  the house was full of men and woman, and there were all the chiefs of the
  Philistines, and on the roof were about three thousand men and woman looking
  at the sports of Sampson. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Sampson
  wept before the Lord, and said, O Lord, my lord, remember me, I pray thee,
  and strengthen me, O God, yet this once, and I will requite one recompense to
  the Philistines for my two eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And
  Sampson took hold of the two pillars of the house on which the house stood,
  and leaned on them, and laid hold of one with his right hand, and the other
  with his left. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Sampson said, Let
  my wife perish with the Philistines: and he bowed himself mightily; and the
  house fell upon the princes, and upon all the people that were in it: and the
  dead whom Sampson slew in his death were more than those whom he slew in his
  life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And his brethren and his
  father’s house went down, and they took him; and they went up and buried him
  between Saraa and Esthaol in the sepulchre of his father Manoe; and he judged
  Israel twenty years.
  <h3 id="judges17">17</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And there was
  a man of mount Ephraim, and his name was Michaias. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred
  pieces of silver which thou tookest of thyself, and about which thou cursedst
  me, and spokest in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it: and his
  mother said, Blessed be my son of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of
  silver to his mother; and his mother said, I had wholly consecrated the money
  to the Lord out of my hand for my son, to make a graven and a molten image,
  and now I will restore it to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But
  he returned the silver to his mother, and his mother took two hundred pieces
  of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, and he made it a graven and a
  molten image; and it was in the house of Michaias. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the house of Michaias was to him the house of
  God, and he made an ephod and theraphin, and he consecrated one of his sons,
  and he became to him a priest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And in
  those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in
  his own eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And there was a young
  man in Bethleem of the tribe of Juda, and he was a Levite, and he was
  sojourning there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the man departed
  from Bethleem the city of Juda to sojourn in whatever place he might find;
  and he came as far as mount Ephraim, and to the house of Michaias to
  accomplish his journey. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Michaias
  said to him, Whence comest thou? and he said to him, I am a Levite of
  Bethleem Juda, and I go to sojourn in any place I may find. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Michaias said to him, Dwell with me, and be
  to me a father and a priest; and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the
  year, and a change of raiment, and thy living. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Levite went and began to dwell with the
  man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Michaias consecrated the Levite, and he
  became to him a priest, and he was in the house of Michaias. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Michaias said, Now I know that the Lord will
  do me good, because a Levite has become my priest.
  <h3 id="judges18">18</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In those days
  there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of Dan sought for
  itself an inheritance to inhabit, because no inheritance had fallen to it
  until that day in the midst of the tribes of the children of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the sons of Dan sent from their
  families five men of valour, from Saraa and from Esthaol, to spy out the land
  and to search it; and they said to them, Go and search out the land. And they
  came as far as the mount of Ephraim to the house of Michaias and they lodged
  there, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> in the house of Michaias, and
  they recognised the voice of the young man the Levite, and turned in thither;
  and said to him, Who brought thee in hither? and what doest thou in this
  place? and what hast thou here? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he
  said to them, Thus and thus did Michaias to me, and he hired me, and I became
  his priest <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they said to him,
  Enquire now of God, and we shall know whether our way will prosper, on which
  we are going. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the priest said to
  them, Go in peace; your way in which ye go, is before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the five men went on, and came to Laisa; and
  they saw the people in the midst of it dwelling securely, at ease as is the
  manner of the Sidonians, and there is no one perverting or shaming a matter
  in the land, no heir extorting treasures; and they are far from the
  Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with any one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the five men came to their brethren to Saraa
  and Esthaol, and said to their brethren, Why sit ye here idle? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they said, Arise, and let us go up against
  them, for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good, yet ye are
  still: delay not to go, an to enter in to possess the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And whensoever ye shall go, ye shall come in upon
  a people secure, and the land is extensive, for God has given it into your
  hand; a place where there is no want of anything that the earth affords.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And there departed thence of the
  families of Dan, from Saraa and from Esthaol, six hundred men, girded with
  weapons of war. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they went up, and
  encamped in Cariathiarim in Juda; therefore it was called in that place the
  camp of Dan, until this day: behold, it is behind Cariathiarim. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they went on thence to the mount of Ephraim,
  and came to the house of Michaias. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And the five men who went to spy out the land of Laisa answered, and said to
  their brethren, Ye know that there is in this place an ephod, and theraphin,
  and a graven and a molten image; and now consider what ye shall do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they turned aside there, and went
  into the house of the young man, the Levite, even into the house of Michaias,
  and asked him how he was. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the six
  hundred men of the sons of Dan who were girded with their weapons of war
  stood by the door of the gate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And
  the five men who went to spy out the land went up, and entered into the house
  of Michaias, and the priest stood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And they took the graven image, and the ephod, and the theraphin, and the
  molten image; and the priest said to them, What are ye doing? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they said to him, Be silent, lay thine hand
  upon thy mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it
  better for thee to be the priest of the house of one man, or to be the priest
  of a tribe and house for a family of Israel? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the heart of the priest was glad, and he took
  the ephod, and the theraphin, and the graven image, and the molten image, and
  went in the midst of the people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> So
  they turned and departed, and put their children and their property and their
  baggage before them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> They went some
  distance from the house of Michaias, and, behold, Michaias and the men in the
  houses near Michaias’ house, cried out, and overtook the children of Dan.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the children of Dan turned their
  face, and said to Michaias, What is the matter with thee that thou hast cried
  out? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Michaias said, Because ye
  have taken my graven image which I made, and my priest, and are gone; and
  what have I remaining? and what is this that ye say to me, Why criest thou?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the children of Dan said to him,
  Let not thy voice be heard with us, lest angry men run upon thee, and take
  away thy life, and the lives of thy house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the children of Dan went their way; and
  Michaias saw that they were stronger than himself, and he returned to his
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the children of Dan took
  what Michaias had made, and the priest that he had, and they came to Laisa,
  to a people quiet and secure; and they smote them with the edge of the sword,
  and burnt the city with fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  there was no deliverer, because the city is far from the Sidonians, and they
  have no intercourse with men, and it is in the valley of the house of Raab;
  and they built the city, and dwelt in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they called the name of the city Dan, after
  the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; and the name of the
  city was Ulamais before. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the
  children of Dan set up the graven image for themselves; and Jonathan son of
  Gerson son of Manasse, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan till
  the time of the carrying away of the nation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And they set up for themselves the graven image
  which Michaias made, all the days that the house of God was in Selom; and it
  was so in those days that there was no king in Israel.
  <h3 id="judges19">19</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And there was
  a Levite sojourning in the sides of mount Ephraim, and he took to himself a
  concubine from Bethleem Juda. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And his
  concubine departed from him, and went away from him to the house of her
  father to Bethleem Juda, and she was there four months. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And her husband rose up, and went after her to
  speak kindly to her, to recover her to himself; and he had his young man with
  him, and a pair of asses; and she brought him into the house of her father;
  and the father of the damsel saw him, and was well pleased to meet him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And his father-in-law, the father of
  the damsel, constrained him, and he stayed with him for three days; and they
  ate and drank, and lodged there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  it came to pass on the fourth day that they rose early, and he stood up to
  depart; and the father of the damsel said to his son-in-law, Strengthen thy
  heart with a morsel of bread, and afterwards ye shall go. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> So they two sat down together and ate and drank:
  and the father of the damsel said to her husband, Tarry now the night, and
  let thy heart be merry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the man
  rose up to depart; but his father-in-law constrained him, and he stayed and
  lodged there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he rose early in the
  morning on the fifth day to depart; and the father of the damsel said,
  Strengthen now thine heart, and quit thyself as a soldier till the day
  decline; and the two ate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the man
  rose up to depart, he and his concubine, and his young man; but his
  father-in-law the father of the damsel said to him, Behold now, the day has
  declined toward evening; lodge here, an let thy heart rejoice; and ye shall
  rise early to-morrow for your journey, and thou shalt go to thy habitation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But the man would not lodge there,
  but he arose and departed, and came to the part opposite Jebus, (this is
  Jerusalem,) and there was with him a pair of asses saddled, and his concubine
  was with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they came as far as
  Jebus: and the day had far advanced, and the young man said to his master,
  Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites, and
  let us lodge in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And his master
  said to him, We will not turn aside to a strange city, where there is not one
  of the children of Israel, but we will pass on as far as Gabaa. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to his young man, Come, and let us
  draw nigh to one of the places, and we will lodge in Gabaa or in Rama.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they passed by and went on, and
  the sun went down upon them near to Gabaa, which is in Benjamin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they turned aside thence to go in to lodge in
  Gabaa; and they went in, and sat down in the street of the city, and there
  was no one who conducted them into a house to lodge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And behold, an old man came out of the field from
  his work in the evening; and the man was of mount Ephraim, and he sojourned
  in Gabaa, and the men of the place were sons of Benjamin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw a traveller in
  the street of the city; and the old man said to him, Whither goest thou, and
  whence comest thou? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he said to
  him, We are passing by from Bethleem Juda to the sides of mount Ephraim: I am
  from thence, and I went as far as Bethleem Juda, and I am going home, and
  there is no man to take me into his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Yet is there straw and food for our asses, and
  bread and wine for me and my handmaid and the young man with thy servants;
  there is no want of anything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the
  old man said, Peace be to thee; only be every want of thine upon me, only do
  thou by no means lodge in the street. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And he brought him into his house, and made room for his asses; and they
  washed their feet, and ate and drank. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And they were comforting their heart, when, behold, the men of the city, sons
  of transgressors, compassed the house, knocking at the door: and they spoke
  to the old man the owner of the house, saying, Bring out the man who came
  into thy house, that we may know him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  And the master of the house came out to them, and said, Nay, brethren, do not
  ye wrong, I pray you, after this man has come into my house; do not ye this
  folly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Behold my daughter a virgin,
  and the man’s concubine: I will bring them out, and humble ye them, and do to
  them that which is good in your eyes; but to this man do not this folly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But the men would not consent to
  hearken to him; so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to
  them; and they knew her, and abused her all night till the morning, and let
  her go when the morning dawned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And
  the woman came toward morning, and fell down at the door of the house where
  her husband was, until it was light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  And her husband rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house,
  and went forth to go on his journey; and, behold, the woman his concubine had
  fallen down by the doors of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he said to her, Rise, and let us
  go; and she answered not, for she was dead: and he took her upon his ass, and
  went to his place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he took his
  sword, and laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve parts, and
  sent them to every coast of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  And it was so, that every one who saw it said, Such a day as this has not
  happened nor has been seen from the day of the going up of the children of
  Israel out of the land of Egypt until this day: take ye counsel concerning
  it, and speak.
  <h3 id="judges20">20</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And all the
  children of Israel went out, and all the congregation was gathered as one
  man, from Dan even to Bersabee, and in the land of Galaad, to the Lord at
  Massepha. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And all the tribes of Israel
  stood before the Lord in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred
  thousand footmen that drew sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to
  Massepha: and the children of Israel came and said, Tell us, where did this
  wickedness take place? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Levite,
  the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I and my
  concubine went to Gabaa of Benjamin to lodge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the men of Gabaa rose up against me, and
  compassed the house by night against me; they wished to slay me, and they
  have humbled my concubine, and she is dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I laid hold of my concubine, and divided her
  in pieces, and sent the parts into every coast of the inheritance of the
  children of Israel; for they have wrought lewdness and abomination in Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Behold, all ye are children of Israel;
  and consider and take counsel here among yourselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And all the people rose up as one man, saying, No
  one of us shall return to his tent, and no one of us shall return to his
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And now this is the thing which
  shall be done in Gabaa; we will go up against it by lot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Moreover we will take ten men for a hundred for
  all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred for a thousand, and a thousand for
  ten thousand, to take provision, to cause them to come to Gabaa of Benjamin,
  to do to it according to all the abomination, which they wrought in Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And all the men of Israel were
  gathered to the city as one man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  the tribes of Israel sent men through the whole tribe of Benjamin, saying,
  What is this wickedness that has been wrought among you? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Now then give up the men the sons of
  transgressors that are in Gabaa, and we will put them to death, and purge out
  wickedness from Israel: but the children of Benjamin consented not to hearken
  to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the children of Benjamin were gathered from
  their cities to Gabaa, to go forth to fight with the children of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the children of Benjamin from
  their cities were numbered in that day, twenty-three thousand, every man
  drawing a sword, besides the inhabitants of Gabaa, who were numbered seven
  hundred chosen men of all the people, able to use both hands alike;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> All these could sling with stones at
  a hair, and not miss. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the men of
  Israel, exclusive of Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that
  drew sword; all these were men of war. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they arose and went up to Baethel, and
  enquired of God: and the children of Israel said, Who shall go up for us
  first to fight with the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Juda shall
  go up first as leader. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the
  children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gabaa.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they went out, all the men of
  Israel, to fight with Benjamin, and engaged with them at Gabaa. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the sons of Benjamin went forth from Gabaa,
  and they destroyed in Israel on that day two and twenty thousand men down to
  the ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the men of Israel
  strengthened themselves, and again engaged in battle in the place where they
  had engaged on the first day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the
  children of Israel went up, and wept before the Lord till evening, and
  enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall we again draw nigh to battle with our
  brethren the children of Benjamin? and the Lord said, Go up against them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the children of Israel advanced
  against the children of Benjamin on the second day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the children of Benjamin went forth to meet
  them from Gabaa on the second day, and destroyed of the children of Israel
  yet further eighteen thousand men down to the ground: all these drew sword.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the children of Israel and all
  the people went up, and came to Baethel; and they wept, and sat there before
  the Lord; and they fasted on that day until evening, and offered
  whole-burnt-offerings and perfect sacrifices, before the Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> for the ark of the Lord God was there in those
  days, <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and Phinees the son of Eleazar
  the son of Aaron stood before it in those days; and the children of Israel
  enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall we yet again go forth to fight with our
  brethren the sons of Benjamin? and the Lord said, Go up, to-morrow I will
  give them into your hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And the
  children of Israel set an ambush against Gabaa round about it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the children of Israel went up against the
  children of Benjamin on the third day, and arrayed themselves against Gabaa
  as before. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the children of
  Benjamin went out to meet the people, and were all drawn out of the city, and
  began to smite and slay the people as before in the roads, whereof one goes
  up to Baethel, and one to Gabaa in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the children of Benjamin said,
  They fall before us as at the first: but the children of Israel said, Let us
  flee, and draw them out from the city into the roads; and they did so.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And all the men rose up out of their
  places, and engaged in Baal Thamar; and the liers in wait of Israel advanced
  from their place from Maraagabe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And
  there came over against Gabaa ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel; and
  the fight was severe; and they knew not that evil was coming upon them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the Lord smote Benjamin before
  the children of Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin in
  that day a hundred and twenty-five thousand men: all these drew sword.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the children of Benjamin saw that
  they were smitten; and the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they
  trusted in the ambuscade which they had prepared against Gabaa. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And when they retreated, then the liers in wait
  rose up, and they moved toward Gabaa, and the whole ambush came forth, and
  they smote the city with the edge of the sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And the children of Israel had a signal of battle
  with the liers in wait, that they should send up a signal of smoke from the
  city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And the children of Israel saw
  that the liers in wait had seized Gabaa, and they stood in line of battle;
  and Benjamin began to smite down wounded ones among the men of Israel about
  thirty men; for they said, Surely they fall again before us, as in the first
  battle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And the signal went up
  increasingly over the city as a pillar of smoke; and Benjamin looked behind
  him, and behold the destruction of the city went up to heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And the men of Israel turned back, and the men of
  Benjamin hasted, because they saw that evil had come upon them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And they turned to the way of the wilderness from
  before the children of Israel, and fled: but the battle overtook them, and
  they from the cities destroyed them in the midst of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And they cut down Benjamin, and pursued him from
  Nua closely till they came opposite Gabaa on the east. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men:
  all these were men of might. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And the
  rest turned, and fled to the wilderness to the rock of Remmon; and the
  children of Israel picked off of them five thousand men; and the children of
  Israel went down after them as far as Gedan, and they smote of them two
  thousand men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And all that fell of
  Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men that drew sword in that day: all these
  were men of might. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And the rest
  turned, and fled to the wilderness to the rock of Remmon, even six hundred
  men; and they sojourned four months in the rock of Remmon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And the children of Israel returned to the
  children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword from the city
  of Methla, even to the cattle, and every thing that was found in all the
  cities: and they burnt with fire the cities they found.
  <h3 id="judges21">21</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now the
  children of Israel swore in Massephath, saying, No man of us shall give his
  daughter to Benjamin for a wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  the people came to Baethel, and sat there until evening before God: and they
  lifted up their voice and wept with a great weeping; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and said, Wherefore, O Lord God of Israel, has
  this come to pass, that to-day one tribe should be counted as missing from
  Israel? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And it came to pass on the
  morrow that the people rose up early, and built there an altar, and offered
  up whole-burnt-offerings and peace offerings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the children of Israel said, Who of all the
  tribes of Israel, went not up in the congregation to the Lord? for there was
  a great oath concerning those who went not up to the Lord to Massephath,
  saying, He shall surely be put to death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the children of Israel relented toward
  Benjamin their brother, and said, To-day one tribe is cut off from Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> What shall we do for wives for the
  rest that remain? whereas we have sworn by the Lord, not to give them of our
  daughters for wives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they said,
  What one man is there of the tribes of Israel, who went not up to the Lord to
  Massephath? and, behold, no man came to the camp from Jabis Galaad to the
  assembly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the people were
  numbered, and there was not there a man from the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the congregation sent thither
  twelve thousand men of the strongest, and they charged them, saying, Go ye
  and smite the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad with the edge of the sword.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And this shall ye do: every male and
  every woman that has known the lying with man ye shall devote to destruction,
  but the virgins ye shall save alive: and they did so. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabis
  Galaad four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him;
  and they brought them to Selom in the land of Chanaan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And all the congregation sent and spoke to the
  children of Benjamin in the rock Remmon, and invited them to make peace.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Benjamin returned to the children
  of Israel at that time, and the children of Israel gave them the women whom
  they had save alive of the daughters of Jabis Galaad; and they were content.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the people relented for Benjamin,
  because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the elders of the congregation said, What
  shall we do for wives for them that remain? for the women have been destroyed
  out of Benjamin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they said, There
  must be an inheritance of them that are escaped of Benjamin; and so a tribe
  shall not be destroyed out of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  For we shall not be able to give them wives of our daughters, because we
  swore among the children of Israel, saying, Cursed is he that gives a wife to
  Benjamin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they said, Lo! now
  there is a feast of the Lord from year to year in Selom, which is on the
  north of Baethel, eastward on the way that goes up from Baethel to Sychem,
  and from the south of Lebona. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  they charged the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the
  vineyards; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and ye shall see; and lo!
  if there come out the daughters of the inhabitants of Selom to dance in
  dances, then shall ye go out of the vineyards and seize for yourselves every
  man a wife of the daughters of Selom, and go ye into the land of Benjamin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And it shall come to pass, when their
  fathers or their brethren come to dispute with us, that we will say to them,
  Grant them freely to us, for we have not taken every man his wife in the
  battle: because ye did not give to them according to the occasion, ye
  transgressed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the children of
  Benjamin did so; and they took wives according to their number from the
  dancers whom they seized: and they went and returned to their inheritance,
  and built the cities, and dwelt in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the children of Israel went thence at that
  time every man to his tribe and his kindred; and they went thence every man
  to his inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And in those days
  there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own
  sight.
