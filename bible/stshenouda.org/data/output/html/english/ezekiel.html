  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now it came to pass in the
  thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I
  was in the midst of the captivity by the river of Chobar; and the heavens
  were opened, and I saw visions of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  On the fifth day of the month; this was the fifth year of the captivity of
  king Joakim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the word of the Lord
  came to Jezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans,
  by the river of Chobar; and the hand of the Lord was upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I looked, and, behold, a sweeping wind came
  from the north, and a great cloud on it, and there was brightness round about
  it, and gleaming fire, and in the midst of it as it were the appearance of
  amber in the midst of the fire, and brightness in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And in the midst as it were the likeness of four
  living creatures. And this was their appearance; the likeness of a man was
  upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And each one had four
  faces, and each one had four wings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And their legs were straight; and their feet were winged, and there were
  sparks, like gleaming brass, and their wings were light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the hand of a man was under their wings on
  their four sides. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the faces of
  them four turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the likeness of their faces was
  the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right of the four; and the
  face of a calf on the left of the four; and the face of an eagle to the four.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the four had their wings spread
  out above; each one had two joined to one another, and two covered their
  bodies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And each one went straight
  forward: wherever the spirit was going they went, and turned not back.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And in the midst of the living
  creatures there was an appearance as of burning coals of fire, as an
  appearance of lamps turning among the living creatures; and the brightness of
  fire, and out of the fire came forth lightning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I
  looked, and, behold, the four had each one wheel on the ground near the
  living creatures. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the appearance
  of the wheels was as the appearance of beryl: and the four had one likeness:
  and their work was as it were a wheel in a wheel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They went on their four sides: they turned not as
  they went; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> neither did their backs
  turn: and they were high: and I beheld them, and the backs of them four were
  full of eyes round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And when
  the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living
  creatures lifted themselves off the earth, the wheels were lifted off.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Wherever the cloud happened to be,
  there was the spirit ready to go: the wheels went and were lifted up with
  them; because the spirit of life was in the wheels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> When those went, the wheels went; and when those
  stood, the wheels stood; and when those lifted themselves off the earth, they
  were lifted off with them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the likeness over the heads of
  the living creatures was as a firmament, as the appearance of crystal, spread
  out over their wings above. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And their
  wings were spread out under the firmament, reaching one to the other; two
  wings to each, covering their bodies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And I heard the sound of their wings when they went, as the sound of much
  water: and when they stood, their wings were let down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And lo! a voice from above the firmament
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> that was over their head, there was
  as the appearance of a sapphire stone, and the likeness of a throne upon it:
  and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as an appearance of a
  man above. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And I saw as it were the
  resemblance of amber from the appearance of the loins and upwards, and from
  the appearance of the loins and under I saw an appearance of fire, and the
  brightness thereof round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> As
  the appearance of the bow when it is in the cloud in days of rain, so was the
  form of brightness round about.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> This was the appearance of the
  likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw and fell upon my face, and heard
  the voice of one speaking: and he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy
  feet, and I will speak to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  the Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me on my
  feet: and I heard him speaking to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And he said to me, Son of Man, I send thee forth to the house of Israel, them
  that provoke me; who have provoked me, they and their fathers to this day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Whether then indeed they
  shall hear or fear, (for it is a provoking house,) yet they shall know that
  thou art a prophet in the midst of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And thou, son of man, fear them not, nor be
  dismayed at their face; (for they will madden and will rise up against thee
  round about, and thou dwellest in the midst of scorpions): be not afraid of
  their words, nor be dismayed at their countenance, for it is a provoking
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And thou shalt speak my words
  to them, whether they will hear or fear: for it is a provoking house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And thou, son of man, hear him that
  speaks to thee; be not thou provoking, as the provoking house: open thy
  mouth, and eat what I give thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I
  looked, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and in it a volume of a book.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he unrolled it before me: and in
  it the front and the back were written upon: and there was written in it
  Lamentation, and mournful song, and woe.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he said to me, Son of Man, eat
  this volume, and go and speak to the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> So he opened my mouth, and caused me to eat the
  volume. And he said to me, Son of man, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  thy mouth shall eat, and thy belly shall be filled with this volume that is
  given to thee. So I ate it; and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he said to me, Son of man, go thy
  way, and go in to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For thou art not sent to a people of
  hard speech, but to the house of Israel; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> neither to many nations of other speech and other
  tongues, nor of harsh language, whose words thou wouldest not understand:
  although if I had sent thee to such, they would have hearkened to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But the house of Israel will not be
  willing to hearken to thee; for they will not hearken to me: for all the
  house of Israel are stubborn and hard-hearted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And, behold, I have made thy face strong against
  their faces, and I will strengthen thy power against their power.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And it shall be continually stronger
  than a rock: be not afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their faces,
  because it is a provoking house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  he said to me, Son of man, receive into thine heart all the words that I have
  spoken to thee, and hear them with thine ears. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And go thy way, go in to the captivity, to the
  children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and say to them, Thus
  saith the Lord; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then the Spirit took me up, and I
  heard behind me the voice as of a great earthquake, saying, Blessed be the
  glory of the Lord from his place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  I perceived the sound of the wings of the living creatures clapping one to
  the other, and the sound of the wheels was near them, and the sound of the
  earthquake. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Spirit lifted me,
  and took me up, and I went in the impulse of my spirit; and the hand of the
  Lord was mighty upon me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Then I
  passed through the air and came into the captivity, and went round to them
  that dwelt by the river of Chobar who were there; and I sat there seven days,
  conversant in the midst of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  after the seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I have made thee a watchman to the
  house of Israel; and thou shalt hear a word of my mouth, and shalt threaten
  them from me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> When I say to the
  wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou hast not warned him, to give warning
  to the wicked, to turn from his ways, that he should live; that wicked man
  shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But if thou warn the wicked, and he
  turn not from his wickedness, and from his way, that wicked man shall die in
  his iniquity, and thou shalt deliver thy soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And when the righteous turns away from his
  righteousness, and commits a trespass, and I shall bring punishment before
  him, he shall die, because thou didst not warn him: he shall even die in his
  sins, because his righteousness shall not be remembered; but his blood will I
  require at thine hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But if thou
  warn the righteous not to sin, and he sin not, the righteous shall surely
  live, because thou hast warned him; and thou shalt deliver thine own soul.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the hand of the Lord came upon
  me; and he said to me, Arise, and go forth into the plain, and there shalt
  thou be spoken to. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I arose, and
  went forth to the plain: and, behold, the glory of the Lord stood there,
  according to the vision, and according to the glory of the Lord, which I saw
  by the river of Chobar: and I fell on my face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Then the Spirit came upon me, and set me on my
  feet, and spoke to me, and said to me, Go in, and shut thyself up in the
  midst of thine house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And thou, son
  of man, behold, bonds are prepared for thee, and they shall bind thee with
  them, and thou shalt not come forth of the midst of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Also I will bind thy tongue, and thou shalt be
  dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: because it is a provoking house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But when I speak to thee, I will open
  thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, He that hears,
  let him hear; and he that is disobedient, let him be disobedient: because it
  is a provoking house.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And thou, son of man, take thee a
  brick, and thou shalt set it before thy face, and shalt portray on it the
  city, even Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And thou shalt
  besiege it, and build works against it, and throw up a mound round about it,
  and pitch camps against it, and set up engines round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And take thou to thyself an iron pan, and thou
  shalt set it for an iron wall between thee and the city: and thou shalt set
  thy face against it, and it shall be in a siege, and thou shalt besiege it.
  This is a sign to the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou shalt lie upon thy left side, and lay the
  iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the
  hundred and fifty days during which thou shalt lie upon it: and thou shalt
  bear their iniquities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For I have
  appointed thee their iniquities for a number of days, for a hundred and
  ninety days: so thou shalt bear the iniquities of the house of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And thou shalt accomplish this, and
  then shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquities of the house
  of Juda forty days: I have appointed thee a day for a year. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> So thou shalt set thy face to the siege of
  Jerusalem, and shalt strengthen thine arm, and shalt prophesy against it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And, behold, I have prepared bonds for
  thee, land thou mayest not turn from thy one side to the other, until the
  days of thy siege shall be accomplished. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Take thou also to thee wheat, and barley, and
  beans, and lentils, and millet, and bread-corn; and thou shalt cast them into
  one earthen vessel, and shalt make them into loaves for thyself; and thou
  shalt eat them a hundred and ninety days, according to the number of the days
  during which thou sleepest on thy side. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou shalt eat thy food by weight, twenty
  shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou shalt drink water by measure, even from
  time to time thou shalt drink the sixth part of a hin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thou shalt eat them as a barley cake: thou
  shalt bake them before their eyes in man’s dung. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord God of
  Israel; Thus shall the children of Israel eat unclean things among the
  Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then I said, Not so, Lord
  God of Israel: surely my soul has not been defiled with uncleanness; nor have
  I eaten, that which died of itself or was torn of beasts from my birth until
  now; neither has any corrupt flesh entered into my mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he said to me, Behold, I have given thee dung
  of oxen instead of man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy loaves upon it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he said to me, Son of man,
  behold, I break the support of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread
  by weight and in want; and shall drink water by measure, and in a state of
  ruin: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> that they may want bread and
  water; and a man and his brother shall be brought to ruin, and they shall
  pine away in their iniquities.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And thou, son of man, take thee a
  sword sharper than a barber’s razor; thou shalt procure it for thyself, and
  shalt bring it upon thine head, and upon thy beard: and thou shalt take a
  pair of scales, and shalt separate the hair. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> A fourth part thou shalt burn in the fire in the
  midst of the city, at the fulfillment of the days of the siege: and thou
  shalt take a fourth part, and burn it up in the midst of it: and a fourth
  part thou shalt cut with a sword round about it: and a fourth part thou shalt
  scatter to the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And thou shalt take thence a few in number, and
  shalt wrap them in the fold of thy garment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou shalt take of these again, and cast them
  into the midst of the fire, and burn them up with fire: from thence shall
  come forth fire; and thou shalt say to the whole house of Israel,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus saith the Lord; This is
  Jerusalem: I have set her and the countries round about her in the midst of
  the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And thou shalt declare
  mine ordinances to the lawless one from out of the nations; and my statutes
  to the sinful one of the countries round about her: because they have
  rejected mine ordinances, and have not walked in my statutes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because your
  occasion for sin has been taken from the nations round about you, and ye have
  not walked in my statutes, nor kept mine ordinances, nay, ye have not even
  done according to the ordinances of the nations round about you; therefore
  thus saith the Lord; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Behold, I am
  against thee, and I will execute judgment in the midst of thee in the sight
  of the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I will do in thee
  things which I have not done, and the like of which I will not do again, for
  all thine abominations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore the
  fathers shall eat their children in the midst of thee, and children shall eat
  their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and I will scatter all
  that are left of thee to every wind. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord; surely, because thou hast defiled my
  holy things with all thine abominations, I also will reject thee; mine eye
  shall not spare, and I will have no mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> A fourth part of thee shall be cut off by
  pestilence, and a fourth part of thee shall be consumed in the midst of thee
  with famine: and as for another fourth part of thee, I will scatter them to
  every wind; and a fourth part of thee shall fall by sword round about thee,
  and I will draw out a sword after them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And my wrath and mine anger shall be accomplished
  upon them: and thou shalt know that I the Lord have spoken in my jealousy,
  when I have accomplished mine anger upon them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will make thee desolate, and thy daughters
  round about thee, in the sight of every one that passes through. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And thou shalt be mourned over and miserable
  among the nations round about thee, when I have executed judgments in thee in
  the vengeance of my wrath. I the Lord have spoken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And when I have sent against them shafts of
  famine, then they shall be consumed, and I will break the strength of thy
  bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> So I will send forth against
  thee famine and evil beasts, and I will take vengeance upon thee; and
  pestilence and blood shall pass through upon thee; and I will bring a sword
  upon thee round about. I the Lord have spoken.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, set thy face
  against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and thou shalt say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear
  the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord to the mountains, and to the hills,
  and to the valleys, and to the forests; Behold, I bring a sword upon you, and
  your high places shall be utterly destroyed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And your altars shall be broken to pieces, and
  your consecrated plats; and I will cast down your slain men before your
  idols. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I will scatter your bones
  round about your altars, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and in all
  your habitations: the cities shall be made desolate, and the high places
  utterly laid waste; that your altars may be destroyed, and your idols be
  broken to pieces, and your consecrated plats be abolished. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And slain men shall fall in the midst of you, and
  ye shall know that I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> When
  there are some of you escaping from the sword among the Gentiles, and when ye
  are scattered in the countries; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> then
  they of you that escape among the nations whither they were carried captive
  shall remember me; (I have sworn an oath against their heart that goes
  a-whoring from me, and their eyes that go a-whoring after their practices;)
  and they shall mourn over themselves for all their abominations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they shall know that I the Lord have spoken.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thus saith the Lord; Clap with thy
  hand, and stamp with thy foot and say, Aha, aha! for all the abominations of
  the house of Israel: they shall fall by the sword, and by pestilence, and by
  famine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> He that is near shall fall by
  the sword; and he that is far off shall die by the pestilence; and he that is
  in the siege shall be consumed with famine: and I will accomplish mine anger
  upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then ye shall know that I
  am the Lord, when your slain are in the midst of your idols round about your
  altars, on every high hill, and under every shady tree, where they offered a
  sweet savour to all their idols. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  I will stretch out my hand against them, and I will make the land desolate
  and ruined from the wilderness of Deblatha, in all their habitations: and ye
  shall know that I am the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Moreover the word of the Lord came
  to me, saying, Also, thou, son of man, say <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Thus saith the Lord; An end is come to the land of
  Israel, the end is come on the four corners of the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Now the end is come to thee, and I will send
  judgment upon thee: and I will take vengeance on thy ways, and will
  recompense all thine abominations upon thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have any
  mercy: for I will recompense thy way upon thee, and thine abominations shall
  be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For thus saith the Lord; Behold, the end is come.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The end is come on thee, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> the inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the
  day has drawn nigh, not with tumult, nor with pangs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Now I will pour out my anger upon thee near at
  hand, and I will accomplish my wrath on thee: and I will judge thee for thy
  ways, and recompense upon thee all thine abominations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have any
  mercy: for I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall
  be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord that smite
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Behold, the day of the Lord!
  although the rod has blossomed, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> pride
  has sprung up, and will break the staff of the wicked one, and that not with
  tumult, nor with haste. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The time is
  come, behold the day: let not the buyer rejoice, and let not the seller
  mourn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For the buyer shall never
  again return to the seller, neither shall a man cleave with the eye of hope
  to his life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Sound ye the trumpet,
  and pass sentence on all together. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  There shall be war with the sword without, and famine and pestilence within:
  he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and famine and pestilence
  shall destroy them that are in the city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But they that escape of them shall be delivered,
  and shall be upon the mountains: and I will slay all the rest, every one for
  his iniquities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> All hands shall be
  completely weakened, and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they shall gird themselves with
  sackcloth, and amazement shall cover them; and shame shall be upon them, even
  upon every face, and baldness upon every head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Their silver shall be cast forth in the streets,
  and their gold shall be despised: their souls shall not be satisfied, and
  their bellies shall not be filled: for it was the punishment of their
  iniquities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> As for their choice
  ornaments, they employed them for pride, and they made of them images of
  their abominations: therefore have I made them uncleanness to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I will deliver them into the
  hands of strangers to make them a prey, and to the pests of the earth for a
  spoil; and they shall profane them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall defile my charge, and
  shall go in to them unguardedly, and profane them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they shall work uncleanness: because the land
  is full of strange nations, and the city is full of iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And I will turn back the boasting of their
  strength; and their holy things shall be defiled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And though propitiation shall come, and one shall
  seek peace, yet there shall be none. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  There shall be woe upon woe, and there shall be message upon message; and a
  vision shall be sought from a prophet; but the law shall perish from the
  priest, and counsel from the elders. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  The prince shall clothe himself with desolation, and the hands of the people
  of the land shall be made feeble: I will do to them according to their ways,
  and according to their judgments will I punish them; and they shall know that
  I am the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass in the sixth
  year, in the fifth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in the
  house, and the elders of Juda were sitting before me: and the hand of the
  Lord came upon me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I looked, and,
  behold, the likeness of a man: from his loins and downwards there was fire,
  and from his loins upwards there was as the appearance of amber. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he stretched forth the likeness of a hand, and
  took me by the crown of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the
  earth and sky, and brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God, to the porch
  of the gate that looks to the north, where was the pillar of the Purchaser.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And, behold, the glory of the Lord God
  of Israel was there, according to the vision which I saw in the plain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he said to me, Son of man, lift up
  thine eyes toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes toward the north, and,
  behold, I looked from the north toward the eastern gate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said to me, Son of man, hast thou seen what
  these do? They commit great abominations here so that I should keep away from
  my sanctuary: and thou shalt see yet greater iniquities. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he brought me to the porch of the court.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he said to me, Son of man, dig: so
  I dug, and behold a door. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said
  to me, Go in, and behold the iniquities which they practise here.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> So I went in and looked; and beheld
  vain abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon
  them round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And seventy men of
  the elders of the house of Israel, and Jechonias the son of Saphan stood in
  their presence in the midst of them, and each one held his censer in his
  hand; and the smoke of the incense went up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he said to me, Thou hast seen, son of man,
  what the elders of the house of Israel do, each one of them in their secret
  chamber: because they have said, The Lord see not; The Lord has forsaken the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to me, Thou shalt
  see yet greater iniquities which these do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he brought me in to the porch of the house of
  the Lord that looks to the north; and, behold there were women sitting there
  lamenting for Thammuz. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he said to
  me, Son of man, thou hast seen; but thou shalt yet see evil practices greater
  then these. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he brought me into
  the inner court of the house of the Lord, and at the entrance of the temple
  of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty men, with
  their back parts toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces turned the
  opposite way; and these were worshipping the sun. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he said to me, Son of man, thou hast seen
  this. Is it a little thing to the house of Juda to practise the iniquities
  which they have practised here? for they have filled the land with iniquity:
  and, behold, these are as scorners. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  Therefore will I deal with them in wrath: mine eye shall not spare, nor will
  I have any mercy.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he cried in mine ears with a
  loud voice, saying, The judgment of the city has drawn nigh; and each had the
  weapons of destruction in his hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And, behold, six men came from the way of the high gate that looks toward the
  north, and each one’s axe was in his hand; and there was one man in the midst
  of them clothed with a long robe down to the feet, and a sapphire girdle was
  on his loins: and they came in and stood near the brazen altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the glory of the God of Israel, that was upon
  them, went up from the cherubs to the porch of the house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And said to him, Go through the midst of
  Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that groan and that
  grieve for all the iniquities that are done in the midst of them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he said to the first in my
  hearing, Go after him into the city, and smite: and let not your eyes spare,
  and have no mercy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Slay utterly old
  man and youth, and virgin, and infants, and women: but go ye not nigh any on
  whom is the mark: begin at my sanctuary. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he said to them, Defile the house, and go out
  and fill the ways with dead bodies, and smite. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it came to pass as they were smiting, that I
  fell upon my face, and cried out, and said, Alas, O Lord! wilt thou destroy
  the remnant of Israel, in pouring out thy wrath upon Jerusalem? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of
  Israel and Juda is become very exceedingly great: for the land is filled with
  many nations, and the city is filled with iniquity and uncleanness: because
  they have said, The Lord has forsaken the earth, The Lord looks not upon it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore mine eye shall not spare,
  neither will I have any mercy: I have recompensed their ways upon their
  heads. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And, behold, the man clothed
  with the long robe, and girt with the girdle about his loins, answered and
  said, I have done as thou didst command me.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then I looked, and, behold, over
  the firmament that was above the head of the cherubs there was a likeness of
  a throne over them, as a sapphire stone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said to the man clothed with the long robe,
  Go in between the wheels that are under the cherubs, and fill thine hands
  with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter them over the city.
  And he went in my sight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the
  cherubs stood on the right hand of the house, as the man went in; and the
  cloud filled the inner court. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Then the
  glory of the Lord departed from the cherubs to the porch of the house; and
  the cloud filled the house, and the court was filled with the brightness of
  the glory of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the sound
  of the cherubs’ wings was heard as far as the outer court, as the voice of
  the Almighty God speaking. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And it came
  to pass, when he gave a charge to the man clothed with the sacred robe,
  saying, Take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubs, that he
  went in, and stood near the wheels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And he stretched forth his hand into the midst of the fire that was between
  the cherubs, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of the man clothed
  with the sacred robe: and he took it, and went out. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I saw the cherubs having the likeness of men’s
  hands under their wings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I saw,
  and behold, four wheels stood by the cherubs, one wheel by each cherub: and
  the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of a carbuncle stone.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And as for their appearance, there
  was one likeness to the four, as if there should be a wheel in the midst of a
  wheel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> When they went, they went on
  their four sides; they turned not when they went, for whichever way the first
  head looked, they went; and they turned not as they went. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And their backs, and their hands, and their
  wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about the four wheels.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And these wheels were called Gelgel
  in my hearing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the cherubs were the same living creature
  which I saw by the river of Chobar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And when the cherubs went, the wheels went, and they were close to them: and
  when the cherubs lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, their
  wheels turned not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> When they stood,
  the wheels stood; and when they mounted up, the wheels mounted up with them:
  because the spirit of life was in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Then the glory of the Lord departed from the
  house, and went up on the cherubs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my
  sight: when they went forth, the wheels were also beside them, and they stood
  at the entrance of the front gate of the house of the Lord; and the glory of
  the God of Israel was upon them above. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> This is the living creature which I saw under the
  God of Israel by the river of Chobar; and I knew that they were cherubs.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Each one had four faces, and each one
  had eight wings; and under their wings was the likeness of men’s hands.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And as for the likeness of their
  faces, these are the same faces which I saw under the glory of the God of
  Israel by the river of Chobar: and they went each straight forward.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Moreover the Spirit took me up, and
  brought me to the front gate of the house of the Lord, that looks eastward:
  and behold at the entrance of the gate were about five and twenty men; and I
  saw in the midst of them Jechonias the son of Ezer, and Phaltias the son of
  Banaeas, the leaders of the people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And the Lord said to me, Son of man, these are the men that devise vanities,
  and take evil counsel in this city: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  who say, Have not the houses been newly built? This is the caldron, and we
  are the flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Therefore prophesy
  against them, prophesy, son of man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, say; Thus saith the
  Lord; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: and I know the devices of your
  spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Ye have multiplied your dead
  in this city, and ye have filled your ways with slain men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord; Your dead whom ye
  have smitten in the midst of it, these are the flesh, and this city is the
  caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Ye fear the sword; and I will bring a sword upon
  you, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I will bring
  you forth out of the midst of it, and will deliver you into the hands of
  strangers, and will execute judgments among you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you on
  the mountains of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it came to pass, while I was
  prophesying, that Phaltias the son of Banaeas died. And I fell upon my face,
  and cried with a loud voice, and said, Alas, alas, O Lord! wilt thou utterly
  destroy the remnant of Israel? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  the word of the Lord came to me, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Son of man, thy brethren, and the men of thy
  captivity, and all the house of Israel are come to the full, to whom the
  inhabitants of Jerusalem said, Keep ye far away from the Lord: the land is
  given to us for an inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  Therefore say thou, Thus saith the Lord; I will cast them off among the
  nations, and will disperse them into every land, yet will I be to them for a
  little sanctuary in the countries which they shall enter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Therefore say thou, Thus saith the Lord; I will
  also take them from the heathen, and gather them out of the lands wherein I
  have scattered them, and will give them the land of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they shall enter in there, and shall remove
  all the abominations of it, and all its iniquities from it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I will give them another heart, and will put
  a new spirit within them; and will extract the heart of stone from their
  flesh, and give them a heart of flesh: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> that they may walk in my commandments, and keep
  mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be
  to them a God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And as for the heart
  set upon their abominations and their iniquities, as their heart went after
  them, I have recompensed their ways on their heads, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Then the cherubs lifted up their
  wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was
  over them above. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the glory of the
  Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood on the mountain which was
  in front of the city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the Spirit
  took me up, and brought me to the land of the Chaldeans, to the captivity, in
  a vision by the Spirit of God: and I went up after the vision which I saw.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And I spoke to the captivity all the
  words of the Lord which he had shewed me.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, thou dwellest
  in the midst of the iniquities of those, who have eyes to see, and see not;
  and have ears to hear, and hear not: because it is a provoking house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thou therefore, son of man, prepare
  thyself baggage for going into captivity by day in their sight; and thou
  shalt be led into captivity from thy place into another place in their sight;
  that they may see that it is a provoking house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou shalt carry forth thy baggage, baggage
  for captivity, by day before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth at even, as
  a captive goes forth, in their sight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Dig for thyself into the wall of the house, and thou shalt pass through it in
  their sight: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> thou shalt be lifted up
  on men’s shoulders, and shalt go forth in secret: thou shalt cover thy face,
  and shalt not see the ground: because I have made thee a sign to the house of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I did thus according to
  all that he commanded me; and I carried forth my baggage for captivity by
  day, and in the evening I dug through the wall for myself, and went out
  secretly; I was taken up on men’s shoulders before them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me in the
  morning, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Son of man, have not
  the house of Israel, the provoking house, said to thee, What doest thou?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Say to them, Thus saith the Lord God,
  the Prince and the Ruler in Israel, even to all the house of Israel who are
  in the midst of them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> say, I am
  performing signs: as I have done, so shall it be to him: they shall go into
  banishment and captivity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the
  prince in the midst of them shall be borne upon shoulders, and shall go forth
  in secret through the wall, and shall dig so that he may go forth thereby: he
  shall cover his face, that he may not be seen by any eye, and he himself
  shall not see the ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I will
  spread out my net upon him, and he shall be caught in my toils: and I will
  bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; but he shall not see it,
  though he shall die there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will
  scatter to every wind all his assistants round about him, and all that help
  him; and I will draw out a sword after them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I
  have scattered them among the nations; and I will disperse them in the
  countries. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I will leave of them a
  few men in number spared from the sword, and from famine, and pestilence;
  that they may declare all their iniquities among the nations whither they
  have gone; and they shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Son of man, eat thy bread with
  sorrow, and drink thy water with torment and affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And thou shalt say to the people of the land,
  Thus saith the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, on the land of Israel;
  They shall eat their bread in scarcity, and shall drink their water in
  desolation, that the land may be desolate with all that it contains: for all
  that dwell in it are ungodly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  their inhabited cities shall be laid utterly waste, and the land shall be
  desolate; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Son of man, what is your parable on
  the land of Israel, that ye say, The days are long, the vision has perished?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Therefore say to them, Thus saith the
  Lord; I will even set aside this parable, and the house of Israel shall no
  more at all use this parable: for thou shalt say to them, The days are at
  hand, and the import of every vision. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  For there shall no more be any false vision, nor any one prophesying
  flatteries in the midst of the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For I the Lord will speak my words; I will speak
  and perform them, and will no more delay, for in your days, O provoking
  house, I will speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Moreover the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Son of man, behold, the
  provoking house of Israel boldly say, The vision which this man sees is for
  many days, and he prophesies for times afar off. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord;
  Henceforth none of my words shall linger, which I shall speak: I will speak
  and do, saith the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, prophesy
  against the prophets of Israel, and thou shalt prophesy, and shalt say to
  them, Hear ye the word of the Lord: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Thus saith the Lord, Woe to them that prophesy out of their own heart, and
  who see nothing at all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thy prophets,
  O Israel, are like foxes in the deserts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They have not continued steadfast, and they have
  gathered flocks against the house of Israel, they that say, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> In the day of the Lord, have not stood, seeing
  false visions, prophesying vanities, who say, The Lord saith, and the Lord
  has not sent them, and they began to try to confirm the word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Have ye not seen a false vision? and spoken vain
  prophecies? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And therefore say, Thus
  saith the Lord; Because your words are false, and your prophecies are vain,
  therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I will stretch forth my hand against the
  prophets that see false visions, and those that utter vanities: they shall
  not partake of the instruction of my people, neither shall they be written in
  the roll of the house of Israel, and they shall not enter into the land of
  Israel; and they shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Because they have caused my people to err,
  saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and one builds a wall, and they plaster
  it, —it shall fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Say to them that
  plaster it, It shall fall; and there shall be a flooding rain; and I will
  send great stones upon their joinings, and they shall fall; and there shall
  be a sweeping wind, and it shall be broken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And lo! the wall has fallen; and will they not
  say to you, Where is your plaster wherewith ye plastered it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord; I will even cause
  to burst forth a sweeping blast with fury, and there shall be a flooding rain
  in my wrath; and in my fury I will bring on great stones for complete
  destruction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will break down
  the wall which ye have plastered, and it shall fall; and I will lay it on the
  ground, and its foundations shall be discovered, and it shall fall; and ye
  shall be consumed with rebukes: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I will accomplish my wrath upon
  the wall, and upon them that plaster it; it shall fall: and I said to you,
  The wall is not, nor they that plaster it, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> even the prophets of Israel, who prophesy
  concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no
  peace, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And thou, son
  of man, set thy face firmly against the daughters of thy people, that
  prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Woe to
  the women that sew pillows under every elbow, and make kerchiefs on the head
  of every stature to pervert souls! The souls of my people are perverted, and
  they have saved souls alive. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they
  have dishonoured me before my people for a handful of barley, and for pieces
  of bread, to slay the souls which should not die, and to save alive the souls
  which should not live, while ye speak to a people hearing vain speeches.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God,
  Behold, I am against your pillows, whereby ye there confound souls, and I
  will tear them away from your arms, and will set at liberty their souls which
  ye pervert to scatter them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I
  will tear your kerchiefs, and will rescue my people out of your hands, and
  they shall no longer be in your hands to be confounded; and ye shall know
  that I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Because ye have
  perverted the heart of the righteous, whereas I perverted him not, and that
  in order to strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not at all
  turn from his evil way and live: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  therefore ye shall not see false visions, and ye shall no more utter
  prophecies: but I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know
  that I am the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel14">14</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And there came to me men of the
  people of Israel, of the elders, and sat before me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Son of man, these men have conceived
  their devices in their hearts, and have set before their faces the punishment
  of their iniquities: shall I indeed answer them? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Therefore speak to them, and thou shalt say to
  them, Thus saith the Lord; Any man of the house of Israel, who shall conceive
  his devices in his heart, and shall set the punishment of his iniquity before
  his face, and shall come to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him according
  to the things in which his mind is entangled, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> that he should turn aside the house of Israel,
  according to their hearts that are estranged from me in their thoughts.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore say to the house of Israel,
  Thus saith the Lord God, Be converted, and turn from your evil practices, and
  from all your sins, and turn your faces back again. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For any man of the house of Israel, or of the
  strangers that sojourn in Israel, who shall separate himself from me, and
  conceive his imaginations in his heart, and set before his face the
  punishment of his iniquity, and come to the prophet to enquire of him
  concerning me; I the Lord will answer him, according to the things wherein he
  is entangled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I will set my face
  against that man, and will make him desolate and ruined, and will cut him off
  from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if a prophet should cause to err
  and should speak, I the Lord have caused that prophet to err, and will
  stretch out my hand upon him, and will utterly destroy him from the midst of
  my people Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they shall bear
  their iniquity according to the trespass of him that asks; and it shall be in
  like manner to the prophet according to the trespass: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> that the house of Israel may no more go astray
  from me, and that they may no more defile themselves with any of their
  transgressions: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God, saith
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the word of the Lord
  came to me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Son of man, if a
  land shall sin against me by committing a trespass, then will I stretch out
  my hand upon it, and will break its staff of bread, and will send forth
  famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And though these three men should be in the midst
  of it, Noe, and Daniel, and Job, they alone should be delivered by their
  righteousness, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> If
  again I bring evil beasts upon the land, and take vengeance upon it, and it
  be ruined, and there be no one to pass through for fear of the wild beasts:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and if these three men should be in
  the midst of it, as I live, saith the Lord, neither sons nor daughters shall
  be saved, but these only shall be saved, and the land shall be destroyed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Or again if I bring a sword upon that
  land, and say, Let the sword go through the land; and I cut off from them man
  and beast: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> though these three men
  were in the midst of it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall not deliver
  sons or daughters, but they only shall be saved themselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Or if again I send pestilence upon that land, and
  pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to destroy from off it man and beast:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and should Noe, and Daniel, and Job,
  be in the midst of it, as I live, saith the Lord, there shall be left them
  neither sons nor daughters; only they by their righteousness shall deliver
  their souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Thus saith the Lord, And
  if I even send upon Jerusalem my four sore judgments, sword, and famine, and
  evil beasts, and pestilence, to destroy from out of it man and beast;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> yet, behold, there shall be men left
  in it, the escaped thereof, who shall lead forth of it sons and daughters:
  behold, they shall go forth to you, and ye shall see their ways and their
  thoughts: and ye shall mourn over the evils which I have brought upon
  Jerusalem, even all the evils which I have brought upon it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they shall comfort you, because ye shall see
  their ways and their thoughts: and ye shall know that I have not done in vain
  all that I have done in it, saith the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel15">15</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And thou, son of man—of
  all the wood, of the branches that are among the trees of the forest, what
  shall be made of the wood of the vine? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Will they take wood of it to make it fit for work? will they take of it a peg
  to hang any vessel upon it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> It is only
  given to the fire to be consumed; the fire consumes that which is yearly
  pruned of it, and it is utterly gone. Will it be useful for any work?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Not even while it is yet whole will it
  be useful for any work: if the fire shall have utterly consumed it, will it
  still be fit for work? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore say,
  Thus saith the Lord, As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I
  have given up to the fire to be consumed, so have I given up the inhabitants
  of Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will set my face
  against them; they shall go forth of the fire, and yet fire shall devour
  them; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set my face against
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I will give up the land to
  ruin, because they have utterly transgressed, saith the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Moreover the word of the Lord came
  to me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, testify to
  Jerusalem of her iniquities; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and thou
  shalt say, Thus saith the Lord to Jerusalem; Thy root and thy birth are of
  the land of Chanaan: thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Chettite.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And as for thy birth in the day
  wherein thou wast born, thou didst not bind thy breasts, and thou wast not
  washed in water, neither wast thou salted with salt, neither wast thou
  swathed in swaddling-bands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Nor did
  mine eye pity thee, to do for thee one of all these things, to feel at all
  for thee; but thou wast cast out on the face of the field, because of the
  deformity of thy person, in the day wherein thou wast born. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I passed by to thee, and saw thee polluted in
  thy blood; and I said to thee, Let there be life out of thy blood:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> increase; I have made thee as the
  springing grass of the field. So thou didst increase and grow, and didst
  enter into great cities: thy breasts were set, and thy hair grew, whereas
  thou wast naked and bare. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I passed
  by thee and saw thee, and, behold, it was thy time and a time of resting; and
  I spread my wings over thee, and covered thy shame, and swear to thee: and I
  entered into covenant with thee, saith the Lord, and thou becamest mine.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I washed thee in water, and washed
  thy blood from thee, and anointed thee with oil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I clothed thee with embroidered garments, and
  clothed thee beneath with purple, and girded thee with fine linen, and
  clothed thee with silk, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and decked
  thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thine hands, and a necklace on
  thy neck. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I put a pendant on thy
  nostril, and rings in thine ears, and a crown of glory on thine head.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> So thou wast adorned with gold and
  silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and variegated work:
  thou didst eat fine flour, and oil, and honey, and didst become extremely
  beautiful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And thy name went forth
  among the nations for thy beauty: because it was perfected with elegance, and
  in the comeliness which I put upon thee, saith the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst go
  a-whoring because of thy renown, and didst pour out thy fornication on every
  passer by. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And thou didst take of thy
  garments, and madest to thyself idols of needlework, and didst go a-whoring
  after them; therefore thou shalt never come in, nor shall the like take
  place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And thou tookest thy fair
  ornaments of my gold and of my silver, of what I gave thee, and thou madest
  to thyself male images, and thou didst commit whoredom with them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And thou didst take thy variegated
  apparel and didst clothe them, and thou didst set before them mine oil and
  mine incense. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And thou tookest my
  bread which I gave thee, (yea I fed thee with fine flour and oil and honey)
  and didst set them before them for a sweet-smelling savour: yea, it was so,
  saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And thou tookest thy
  sons and thy daughters, whom thou borest, and didst sacrifice these to them
  to be destroyed. Thou didst go a-whoring as if that were little, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and didst slay thy children, and gavest them up
  in offering them to them for an expiation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> This is beyond all thy fornication, and thou
  didst not remember thine infancy, when thou wast naked and bare, and didst
  live though defiled in thy blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  it came to pass after all thy wickedness, saith the Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> that thou didst build thyself a house of
  fornication, and didst make thyself a public place in every street;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and on the head of every way thou
  didst set up thy fornications, and didst defile thy beauty, and didst open
  thy feet to every passer by, and didst multiply thy fornication. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And thou didst go a-whoring after the children of
  Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh; and didst go a-whoring, often to provoke
  me to anger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And if I stretch out my
  hand against thee, then will I abolish thy statutes, and deliver thee up to
  the wills of them that hate thee, even to the daughters of the Philistines
  that turned thee aside from the way wherein thou sinned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And thou didst go a-whoring to the daughters of
  Assur, and not even thus wast thou satisfied; yea, thou didst go a-whoring,
  and wast not satisfied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And thou
  didst multiply thy covenants with the land of the Chaldeans; and not even
  with these wast thou satisfied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Why
  should I make a covenant with thy daughter, saith the Lord, while thou doest
  all these things, the works of a harlot? and thou hast gone a-whoring in a
  threefold degree with thy daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  Thou hast built a house of harlotry in every top of a way, and hast set up
  thine high place in every street; and thou didst become as a harlot gathering
  hires. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> An adulteress resembles thee,
  taking rewards of her husband. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> She
  has even given rewards to all that went a-whoring after her, and thou hast
  given rewards to all thy lovers, yea, thou didst load them with rewards, that
  they should come to thee from every side for thy fornication. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And there has happened in thee perverseness in
  thy fornication beyond other women, and they have committed fornication with
  thee, in that thou givest hires over and above, and hires were not given to
  thee; and thus perverseness happened in thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Therefore, harlot, hear the word of the Lord:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Thus saith the Lord, Because thou
  hast poured forth thy money, therefore thy shame shall be discovered in thy
  harlotry with thy lovers, and with regard to all the imaginations of thine
  iniquities, and for the blood of thy children which thou hast given to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Therefore, behold, I will gather all
  thy lovers with whom thou hast consorted, and all whom thou hast loved, with
  all whom thou didst hate; and I will gather them against thee round about,
  and will expose thy wickedness to them, and they shall see all thy shame.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And I will be avenged on thee with
  the vengeance of an adulteress, and I will bring upon thee blood of fury and
  jealousy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And I will deliver thee
  into their hands, and they shall break down thy house of harlotry, and
  destroy thine high place; and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and
  shall take thy proud ornaments, and leave thee naked and bare. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And they shall bring multitudes upon thee, and
  they shall stone thee with stones, and pierce thee with their swords.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And they shall burn thine houses with
  fire, and shall execute vengeance on thee in the sight of many women: and I
  will turn thee back from harlotry, and I will no more give thee rewards.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> So will I slacken my fury against
  thee, and my jealousy shall be removed from thee, and I will rest, and be no
  more careful for thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Because thou
  didst not remember thine infancy, and thou didst grieve me in all these
  things; therefore, behold, I have recompensed thy ways upon thine head, saith
  the Lord: for thus hast thou wrought ungodliness above all thine other
  iniquities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> These are all the things
  they have spoken against thee in a proverb, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> As is the mother, so is thy mother’s daughter:
  thou art she that has rejected her husband and her children; and the sisters
  of thy sisters have rejected their husbands and their children: your mother
  was a Chettite, and your father an Amorite. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Your elder sister who dwells on thy left hand is
  Samaria, she and her daughters: and thy younger sister, that dwells on the
  right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Yet notwithstanding thou hast not walked in their
  ways, neither hast thou done according to their iniquities within a little,
  but thou hast exceeded them in all thy ways. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> As I live, saith the Lord, this Sodom and her
  daughters have not done as thou and thy daughters have done. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Moreover this was the sin of thy sister Sodom,
  pride: she and her daughters lived in pleasure, in fullness of bread and in
  abundance: this belonged to her and her daughters, and they helped not the
  hand of the poor and needy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And they
  boasted, and wrought iniquities before me: so I cut them off as I saw fit.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Also Samaria has not sinned according
  to half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine iniquities beyond them,
  and thou hast justified thy sisters in all thine iniquities which thou hast
  committed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> Thou therefore bear thy
  punishment, for that thou hast corrupted thy sisters by thy sins which thou
  hast committed beyond them; and thou hast made them appear more righteous
  than thyself: thou therefore be ashamed, and bear thy dishonour, in that thou
  hast justified thy sisters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And I
  will turn their captivity, even the captivity of Sodom and her daughters; and
  I will turn the captivity of Samaria and her daughters; and I will turn thy
  captivity in the midst of them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> that
  thou mayest bear thy punishment, and be dishonoured for all that thou hast
  done in provoking me to anger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And
  thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall be restored as they were at the
  beginning, and thou and thy daughters shall be restored as ye were at the
  beginning. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And surely thy sister
  Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the days of thy pride: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(57)</span> before thy wickedness was discovered, even now
  thou art the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round
  about her, even of the daughters of the Philistines that compass thee round
  about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> As for thine ungodliness and
  thine iniquities, thou hast borne them, saith the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> Thus saith the Lord; I will even do to thee as
  thou hast done, as thou hast dealt shamefully in these things to transgress
  my covenant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> And I will remember my
  covenant made with thee in the days of thine infancy, and I will establish to
  thee an everlasting covenant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> Then
  thou shalt remember thy way, and shalt be utterly dishonoured when thou
  receivest thine elder sisters with thy younger ones: and I will give them to
  thee for building up, but not by thy covenant. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And I will establish my covenant with thee; and
  thou shalt know that I am the Lord: <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span>
  that thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and mayest no more be able to open
  thy mouth for thy shame, when I am reconciled to thee for all that thou hast
  done, saith the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel17">17</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, relate a tale,
  and speak a parable to the house of Israel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; A great
  eagle with large wings, spreading them out very far, with many claws, which
  has the design of entering into Libanus—and he took the choice branches of
  the cedar: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> he cropped off the ends of
  the tender twigs, and brought them into the land of Chanaan; he laid them up
  in a walled city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he took of the
  seed of the land, and sowed it in a field planted by much water; he set it in
  a conspicuous place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And it sprang up,
  and became a weak and little vine, so that the branches thereof appeared upon
  it, and its roots were under it: and it became a vine, and put forth shoots,
  and sent forth its tendrils. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And there
  was another great eagle, with great wings and many claws: and, behold, this
  vine bent itself round toward him, and her roots were turned towards him, and
  she sent forth her branches towards him, that he might water her together
  with the growth of her plantation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> She
  thrives in a fair field by much water, to produce shoots and bear fruit, that
  she might become a great vine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord; Shall it prosper? shall not the roots of
  her tender stem and her fruit be blighted? yea, all her early shoots shall be
  dried up, and that not by a mighty arm, nor by many people, to tear her up
  from her roots. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And, behold, it
  thrives: shall it prosper? shall it not wither as soon as the east wind
  touches it? it shall be withered together with the growth of its shoots.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Moreover the word of the Lord came to
  me saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Son of man, say now to the
  provoking house, Know ye not what these things were? say to them, Whenever
  the king of Babylon shall come against Jerusalem, then he shall take her king
  and her princes, and shall take them home to Babylon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he shall take of the seed royal, and shall
  make a covenant with him, and shall bind him with an oath: and he shall take
  the princes of the land: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> that it may
  become a weak kingdom, so as never to lift itself up, that he may keep his
  covenant, and establish it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And if he
  shall revolt from him, to send his messengers into Egypt, that they may give
  him horses and much people; shall he prosper? shall he that acts as an
  adversary be preserved? and shall he that transgresses the covenant be
  preserved? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> As I live, saith the Lord,
  verily in the place where the king is that made him king, who dishonoured my
  oath, and who broke my covenant, shall he die with him in the midst of
  Babylon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Pharaoh shall make war
  upon him not with a large force or great multitude, in throwing up a mound,
  and in building of forts, to cut off souls. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Whereas he has profaned the oath so as to break
  the covenant, when, behold, I engage his hand, and he has done all these
  things to him, he shall not escape. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord; As I live, surely mine oath which he has
  profaned, and my covenant which he has transgressed, I will even recompense
  it upon his head. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And I will spread a
  net upon him, and he shall be caught in its snare. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> In every battle of his they shall fall by the
  sword, and I will scatter his remnant to every wind: and ye shall know that I
  the Lord have spoken it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For thus
  saith the Lord; I will even take of the choice branches of the cedar from the
  top thereof, I will crop off their hearts, and I will plant it on a high
  mountain: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and I will hang it on a
  lofty mountain of Israel: yea, I will plant it, and it shall put forth
  shoots, and shall bear fruit, and it shall be a great cedar: and every bird
  shall rest beneath it, even every fowl shall rest under its shadow: its
  branches shall be restored. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And all
  the trees of the field shall know that I am the Lord that bring low the high
  tree, and exalt the low tree, and wither the green tree, and cause the dry
  tree to flourish: I the Lord have spoken, and will do it.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel18">18</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, what mean ye
  by this parable among the children of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten
  unripe grapes, and the children’s teeth have been set on edge? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> As I live, saith the Lord, surely this parable
  shall no more be spoken in Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For
  all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son,
  they are mine: the soul that sins, it shall die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the man who shall be just, who executes
  judgment and righteousness, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> who shall
  not eat upon the mountains, and shall not at all lift up his eyes to the
  devices of the house of Israel, and shall not defile his neighbor’s wife, and
  shall not draw nigh to her that is removed, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and shall not oppress any man, but shall return
  the pledge of the debtor, and shall be guilty of no plunder, shall give his
  bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and shall not lend his money upon usury, and shall
  not receive usurious increase, and shall turn back his hand from injustice,
  shall execute righteous judgment between a man and his neighbor, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and has walked in my commandments and kept mine
  ordinances, to do them; he is righteous, he shall surely live, saith the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And if he beget a mischievous
  son, shedding blood and committing sins, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> who has not walked in the way of his righteous
  father, but has even eaten upon the mountains, and has defiled his neighbor’s
  wife, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and has oppressed the poor and
  needy, and has committed robbery, and not restored a pledge, and has set his
  eyes upon idols, has wrought iniquities, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> has lent upon usury, and taken usurious increase;
  he shall by no means live: he has wrought all these iniquities; he shall
  surely die; his blood shall be upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if he beget a son, and the son see all his
  father’s sins which he has wrought, and fear, and not do according to them,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and if he has not eaten on the
  mountains, and has not set his eyes on the devices of the house of Israel,
  and has not defiled his neighbor’s wife, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and has not oppressed a man, and has not retained
  the pledge, nor committed robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has
  clothed the naked, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and has turned
  back his hand from unrighteousness, has not received interest or usurious
  increase, has wrought righteousness, and walked in mine ordinances; he shall
  not die for the iniquities of his father, he shall surely live. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But if his father grievously afflict, or plunder,
  he has wrought enmity in the midst of my people, and shall die in his
  iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But ye will say, Why has
  not the son borne the iniquity of the father? Because the son has wrought
  judgment and mercy, has kept all my statues, and done them, he shall surely
  live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But the soul that sins shall
  die: and the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the
  father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall
  be upon him, and the iniquity of the transgressor shall be upon him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And if the transgressor turn away
  from all his iniquities which he has committed, and keep all my commandments,
  and do justice and mercy, he shall surely live, and shall by no means die.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> None of his trespasses which he has
  committed shall be remembers: in his righteousness which he has done he shall
  live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Shall I at all desire death of
  the sinner, saith the Lord, as I desire that he should turn from his evil
  way, and live? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But when the righteous
  man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, according to all
  the transgressions which the transgressor has wrought, none of his
  righteousness which he has wrought shall be at all remembered: in his
  trespass wherein he has trespassed, and in his sins wherein he has sinned, in
  them shall he die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Yet ye have said,
  The way of the Lord is not straight. Hear now, all the house of Israel; will
  not my way be straight? Is your way straight? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> When the righteous turns away from his
  righteousness and commits a trespass, and dies in the trespass he has
  committed, he shall even die in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  And when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed,
  and shall do judgment and justice, he has kept his soul, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and has turned away from all his ungodliness
  which he has committed: he shall surely live, he shall not die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Yet the house of Israel say, The way of the Lord
  is not right. Is not my way right, O house of Israel? is not your way wrong?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> I will judge you, O house of Israel,
  saith the Lord, each one according to his way: be converted, and turn from
  all your ungodliness, and it shall not become to you the punishment of
  iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Cast away from yourselves
  all your ungodliness wherein ye have sinned against me; and make to
  yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why should ye die, O house of
  Israel? <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For I desire not the death of
  him that dies, saith the Lord.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Moreover do thou take up a
  lamentation for the prince of Israel, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  and say, Why is thy mother become a whelp in the midst of lions? in the midst
  of lions she has multiplied her whelps. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And one of her whelps sprang forth; he became a
  lion, and learned to take prey, he devoured men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the nations heard a report of him; he was
  caught in their pit, and they brought him into the land of Egypt in chains.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And she saw that he was driven away
  from her, and her hope of him perished, and she took another of her whelps;
  she made him a lion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he went up
  and down in the midst of lions, he became a lion, and learned to take prey,
  he devoured men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he prowled in his
  boldness and laid waste their cities, and made the land desolate, and the
  fullness of it, by the voice of his roaring. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Then the nations set upon him from the countries
  round about, and they spread their nets upon him: he was taken in their pit.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they put him in chains and in a
  cage, and he came to the king of Babylon; and he cast him into prison, that
  his voice should not be heard on the mountains of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thy mother was as a vine and as a blossom on a
  pomegranate tree, planted by water: her fruit and her shoot abounded by
  reason of much water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And she became
  a rod for a tribe of princes, and was elevated in her bulk in the midst of
  other trees, and she saw her bulk in the multitude of her branches.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But she was broken down in wrath, she
  was cast upon the ground, and the east wind dried up her choice branches:
  vengeance came upon them, and the rod of her strength was withered; fire
  consumed it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And now they have
  planted her in the wilderness, in a dry land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And fire is gone out of a rod of her choice
  boughs, and has devoured her; and there was no rod of strength in her. Her
  race is become a parable of lamentation, and it shall be for a
  lamentation.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel20">20</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass in the seventh
  year, on the fifteenth day of the month, there came men of the elders of the
  house of Israel to enquire of the Lord, and they sat before me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Son of man, speak to the elders of the
  house of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord; Are ye come
  to enquire of me? As I live, I will not be enquired of by you, saith the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Shall I utterly take vengeance
  on them, son of man? testify to them of the iniquities of their fathers:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith
  the Lord; From the day that I chose the house of Israel, and became known to
  the seed of the house of Jacob, and was known to them in the land of Egypt,
  and helped them with my hand, saying, I am the Lord your God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> in that day I helped them with my hand, to bring
  them out of the land of Egypt into the land which I prepared for them, a land
  flowing with milk and honey, it is abundant beyond every land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I said to them, Let every one cast away the
  abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the devices of
  Egypt: I am the Lord your God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But
  they revolted from me, and would not hearken to me: they cast not away the
  abominations of their eyes, and forsook not the devices of Egypt: then I said
  that I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my wrath upon them in
  the midst of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But I wrought so
  that my name should not be at all profaned in the sight of the Gentiles, in
  the midst of whom they are, among whom I was made known to them in their
  sight, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I brought them into the wilderness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I gave them my commandments, and
  made known to them mine ordinances, all which if a man shall do, he shall
  even live in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I gave them my
  sabbaths, that they should be for a sign between me and them, that they
  should know that I am the Lord that sanctify them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I said to the house of Israel in the
  wilderness, Walk ye in my commandments: but they walked not in them, and they
  rejected mine ordinances, which if a man shall do, he shall even live in
  them; and they grievously profaned my sabbaths: and I said that I would pour
  out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But I wrought so that my name should not be at
  all profaned before the Gentiles, before whose eyes I brought them out.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But I lifted up my hand against them
  in the wilderness once for all, that I would not bring them into the land
  which I gave them, a land flowing with milk and honey, it is sweeter than all
  lands: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> because they rejected mine
  ordinances, and walked not in my commandments, but profaned my sabbaths, and
  went after the imaginations of their hearts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Yet mine eyes spared them, so as not to destroy
  them utterly, and I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I said to their children in the
  wilderness, Walk not ye in the customs of your fathers, and keep not their
  ordinances, and have no fellowship with their practices, nor defile
  yourselves with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I am the Lord
  your God; walk in my commandments, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and hallow my sabbaths, and let them
  be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But they provoked me, and their
  children walked not in my commandments, and they took no heed to mine
  ordinances to do them, which if a man shall do, he shall even live in them,
  and they profaned my sabbaths: then I said that I would pour out my wrath
  upon them in the wilderness, to accomplish mine anger upon them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But I wrought so that my name might not be at all
  profaned before the Gentiles; and I brought them out in their sight.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> I lifted up my hand against them in
  the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the Gentiles, and disperse
  them in the countries; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> because they
  kept not mine ordinances, and rejected my commandments, and profaned my
  sabbaths, and their eyes went after the imaginations of their fathers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> So I gave them commandments that were
  not good, and ordinances in which they should not live. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And I will defile them by their own decrees, when
  I pass through upon every one that opens the womb, that I may destroy them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Therefore, son of man, speak to the
  house of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord: Hitherto
  have your fathers provoked me in their trespasses in which they transgressed
  against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Whereas I brought them
  into the land concerning which I lifted up mine hand to give it them; and
  they looked upon every high hill, and every shady tree, and they sacrificed
  there to their gods, and offered there sweet-smelling savour, and there they
  poured out their drink-offerings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And
  I said to them, What is Abama, that ye go in thither? and they called its
  name Abama, until this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Therefore
  say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Do ye pollute yourselves
  with the iniquities of your fathers, and do ye go a-whoring after their
  abominations, <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> and do ye pollute
  yourselves with the first-fruits of your gifts, in the offerings wherewith ye
  pollute yourselves in all your imaginations, until this day; and shall I
  answer you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord, I will not answer
  you, neither shall this thing come upon your spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And it shall not be as ye say, We will be as the
  nations, and as the tribes of the earth, to worship stocks and stones.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord,
  I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and with
  outpoured wrath: <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> I will bring you out
  from the nations, and will take you out of the lands wherein ye were
  dispersed, with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and with outpoured wrath.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And I will bring you into the
  wilderness of the nations, and will plead with you there face to face.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> As I pleaded with your fathers in the
  wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I judge you, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And I will cause you to pass under my
  rod, and I will bring you in by number. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And I will separate from among you the ungodly
  and the revolters; for I will lead them forth out of their place of
  sojourning, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall
  know that I am the Lord, even the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And as to you, O house of Israel, thus saith the
  Lord, even the Lord; Put away each one his evil practices, and hereafter if
  ye hearken to me, then shall ye no more profane my holy name by your gifts
  and by devices. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> For upon my holy
  mountain, on the high mountain, saith the Lord, even the Lord, there shall
  all the house of Israel serve me for ever: and there will I accept you, and
  there will I have respect to your first-fruits, and the first-fruits of your
  offerings, in all your holy things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> I
  will accept you with a sweet-smelling savour, when I bring you out from the
  nations, and take you out of the countries wherein ye have been dispersed;
  and I will be sanctified among you in the sight of the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have
  brought you into the land of Israel, into the land concerning which I lifted
  up my hand to give it to your fathers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And ye shall there remember your ways, and your
  devices wherewith ye defiled yourselves; and ye shall bewail yourselves for
  all your wickedness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And ye shall
  know that I am the Lord, when I have done thus to you, that my name may not
  be profaned in your evil ways, and in your corrupt devices, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Son of man, set thy face
  against Thaeman, and look toward Darom, and prophesy against the chief forest
  of Nageb, <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> and thou shalt say to the
  forest of Nageb, Hear the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord, even the
  Lord; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour in thee every
  green tree, and every dry tree: the flame that is kindled shall not be
  quenched, and every face shall be scorched with it from the south to the
  north. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And all flesh shall know that
  I the Lord have kindled it: it shall not be quenched. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And I said, Not so, O Lord God! they say to me,
  Is not this that is spoken a parable?</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel21">21</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Therefore prophesy, son of
  man, set thy face steadfastly toward Jerusalem, and look toward their holy
  places, and thou shalt prophesy against the land of Israel, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and thou shalt say to the land of Israel, Thus
  saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out
  of its sheath, and I will destroy out of thee the transgressor and
  unrighteous. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Because I will destroy
  out of thee the unrighteous and the transgressor, therefore so shall my sword
  come forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and all flesh shall know that I the
  Lord have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath: it shall not return any
  more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And thou, son of man, groan with
  the breaking of thy loins; thou shalt even groan heavily in their sight.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it shall come to pass, if they
  shall say to thee, Wherefore dost thou groan? that thou shalt say, For the
  report; because it comes: and every heart shall break, and all hands shall
  become feeble, and all flesh and every spirit shall faint, and all thighs
  shall be defiled with moisture: behold, it comes, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Son of man, prophesy, and thou
  shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; Say, Sword, sword, be sharpened and rage,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> that thou mayest slay victims; be
  sharpened that thou mayest be bright, ready for slaughter, slay, set at
  nought, despise every tree. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he
  made it ready for his hand to hold: the sword is sharpened, it is ready to
  put into the hand of the slayer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Cry
  out and howl, son of man: for this sword is come upon my people, this sword
  is come upon all the princes of Israel: they shall be as strangers: judgment
  with the sword is come upon my people: therefore clap thine hands, for
  sentence has been passed: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and what if
  even the tribe be rejected? it shall not be, saith the Lord God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And thou, son of man, prophesy, and clap thine
  hands, and take a second sword: the third sword is the sword of the slain,
  the great sword of the slain: and thou shalt strike them with amazement, lest
  the heart should faint <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and the weak
  ones be multiplied at every gate—they are given up to the slaughter of the
  sword: it is well fitted for slaughter, it is well fitted for glittering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And do thou go on, sharpen thyself on
  the right and on the left whithersoever thy face may set itself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I also will clap my hands, and let loose my
  fury: I the Lord have spoken it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  the word of the Lord came to me, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and thou, son of man, appoint thee two ways, that
  the sword of the king of Babylon may enter in: the two shall go forth of one
  country; and there shall be a force at the top of the way of the city, thou
  shalt set it at the top of the way, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  that the sword may enter in upon Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and upon
  Judea, and upon Jerusalem in the midst thereof. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For the king of Babylon shall stand on the old
  way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination, to make bright the
  arrow, and to enquire of the graven images, and to examine the victims.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> On his right was the divination
  against Jerusalem, to cast a mound, to open the mouth in shouting, to lift up
  the voice with crying, to cast a mound against her gates, to cast up a heap,
  and to build forts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he was to
  them as one using divination before them, and he himself recounting his
  iniquities, that they might be borne in mind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because ye have
  caused your iniquities to be remembered, in the discovery of your wickedness,
  so that your sins should be seen, in all your wickedness and in your evil
  practices; because ye have caused remembrance of them, in these shall ye be
  taken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And thou profane wicked prince
  of Israel, whose day, even an end, is come in a sea of iniquity, thus saith
  the Lord; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Thou hast taken off the
  mitre and put on the crown, it shall not have such another after it: thou
  hast abased that which was high, and exalted that which was low. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Injustice, injustice, injustice, will I make it:
  woe to it: such shall it be until he comes to whom it belongs; and I will
  deliver it to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And thou, son of
  man, prophesy, and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, concerning the
  children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and thou shalt say, O
  sword, sword, drawn for slaughter, and drawn for destruction, awake, that
  thou mayest gleam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> While thou art
  seeing vain visions, and while thou art prophesying falsehoods, to bring
  thyself upon the necks of ungodly transgressors, the day is come, even an
  end, in a season of iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Turn,
  rest not in this place wherein thou wert born: in thine own land will I judge
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And I will pour out my wrath
  upon thee, I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath, and I will
  deliver thee into the hands of barbarians skilled in working destruction.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Thou shalt be fuel for fire; thy
  blood shall be in the midst of thy land; there shall be no remembrance at all
  of thee: for I the Lord have spoken it. <span style=

  Lord God: O city that sheds blood in the midst of her, so that her time
  should come, and that forms devices against herself, to defile herself;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> in their blood which thou hast shed,
  thou hast transgressed; and in thy devices which thou hast formed, thou hast
  polluted thyself; and thou hast brought nigh thy days, and hast brought on
  the time of thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach to the Gentiles,
  and a mockery to all the countries, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> to
  those near thee, and to those far distant from thee; and they shall mock
  thee, thou that art notoriously unclean, and abundant in iniquities.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Behold, the princes of the house of
  Israel have conspired in thee each one with his kindred, that they might shed
  blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> In thee they have reviled
  father and mother; and in thee they have behaved unjustly toward the
  stranger: they have oppressed the orphan and widow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they have set at nought my holy things, and in
  thee they have profaned my sabbaths. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  There are robbers in thee, to shed blood in thee; and in thee they have eaten
  upon the mountains: they have wrought ungodliness in the midst of thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> In thee they have uncovered the
  father’s shame; and in thee they have humbled her that was set apart for
  uncleanness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They have dealt
  unlawfully each one with his neighbor’s wife; and each one in ungodliness has
  defiled his daughter-in-law: and in thee they have humbled each one his
  sister, the daughter of his father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  In thee they have received gifts to shed blood; they have received in thee
  interest and usurious increase; and by oppression thou hast brought thy
  wickedness to the full, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if I shall smite my hand at thine iniquities
  which thou hast accomplished, which thou hast wrought, and at thy blood that
  has been shed in the midst of thee, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  shall thy heart endure? shall thine hands be strong in the days which I bring
  upon thee? I the Lord have spoken, and will do it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I will scatter thee among the nations, and
  disperse thee in the countries, and thy uncleanness shall be removed out of
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I will give heritages in
  thee in the sight of the nations, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Son of man, behold, the house
  of Israel are all become to me as it were mixed with brass, and iron, and
  tin, and lead; they are mixed up in the midst of the silver. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; Because
  ye have become one mixture, therefore I will gather you into the midst of
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> As silver, and brass, and
  iron, and tin, and lead, are gathered into the midst of the furnace, to blow
  fire into it, that they may be melted: so will I take you in my wrath, and I
  will gather and melt you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I will
  blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst
  thereof. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> As silver is melted in the
  midst of a furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall
  know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath upon you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Son of man, say to her, Thou art the
  land that is not rained upon, neither has rain come upon thee in the day of
  wrath; <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> whose princes in the midst of
  her are as roaring lions seizing prey, devouring souls by oppression, and
  taking bribes; and thy widows are multiplied in the midst of thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Her priests also have set at nought
  my law, and profaned my holy things: they have not distinguished between the
  holy and profane, nor have they distinguished between the unclean and the
  clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was profaned in the
  midst of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Her princes in the
  midst of her are as wolves ravening to shed blood, that they may get
  dishonest gain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And her prophets that
  daub them shall fall, that see vanities, that prophesy falsehoods, saying,
  Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord has not spoken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> That sorely oppress the people of the land with
  injustice, and commit robbery; oppressing the poor and needy, and not dealing
  justly with the stranger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And I
  sought from among them a man behaving uprightly, and standing before me
  perfectly in the time of wrath, so that I should not utterly destroy her: but
  I found him not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> So I have poured out
  my wrath upon her in the fury of mine anger, to accomplish it. I have
  recompensed their ways on their own heads, saith the Lord God.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel23">23</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, there were two
  women, daughters of one mother: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and
  they went a-whoring in Egypt in their youth: there their breasts fell, there
  they lost their virginity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And their
  names were Oola the elder, and Ooliba her sister: and they were mine, and
  bore sons and daughters: and as for their names, Samaria was Oola, and
  Jerusalem was Ooliba. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Oola went
  a-whoring from me, and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians that were her
  neighbors, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> clothed with purple,
  princes and captains; they were young men and choice, all horseman riding on
  horses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And she bestowed her
  fornication upon them; all were choice sons of the Assyrians: and on
  whomsoever she doted herself, with them she defiled herself in all their
  devices. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And she forsook not her
  fornication with the Egyptians: for in her youth they committed fornication
  with her, and they deflowered her, and poured out their fornication upon her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore I delivered her into the
  hands of her lovers, into the hands of the children of the Assyrians, on whom
  she doted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> They uncovered her shame:
  they took her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became
  a byword among women: and they wrought vengeance in her for the sake of the
  daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And her sister Ooliba saw
  it, and she indulged in her fondness more corruptly than she, and in her
  fornication more than the fornication of her sister. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> She doted upon the sons of the Assyrian, princes
  and captains, her neighbours, clothed with fine linen, horsemen riding on
  horses; they were all choice young men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I saw that they were defiled, that the two
  had one way. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And she increased her
  fornication, and she saw men painted on the wall, likenesses of the Chaldeans
  painted with a pencil, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> having
  variegated girdles on their loins, having also richly dyed attire upon their
  heads; all had a princely appearance, the likeness of the children of the
  Chaldeans, of their native land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  she doted upon them as soon as she saw them, and sent forth messengers to
  them into the land of the Chaldeans. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And the sons of Babylon came to her, into the bed of rest, and they defiled
  her in her fornication, and she was defiled by them, and her soul was
  alienated from them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And she exposed
  her fornication, and exposed her shame: and my soul was alienated from her,
  even as my soul was alienated from her sister. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And thou didst multiply thy fornication, so as to
  call to remembrance the days of thy youth, wherein thou didst commit whoredom
  in Egypt, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and thou didst dote upon
  the Chaldeans, whose flesh is as the flesh of the asses, and their members as
  the members of horses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And thou didst
  look upon the iniquity of thy youth, the things which thou wroughtest in
  Egypt in thy lodgings, where were the breasts of thy youth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the Lord; Behold, I
  will stir up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I
  will bring them upon thee round about, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> the children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans,
  Phacuc, and Sue, and Hychue, and all the sons of the Assyrians with them;
  choice young men, governors and captains, all princes and renowned, riding on
  horses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they all shall come upon
  thee from the north, chariots and wheels, with a multitude of nations,
  shields and targets; and the enemy shall set a watch against thee round
  about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall take vengeance on
  thee with their judgments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And I will
  bring upon thee my jealousy, and they shall deal with thee in great wrath:
  they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and shall cast down thy remnant
  with the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy remnant
  fire shall devour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they shall
  strip thee of thy raiment, and take away thine ornaments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> So I will turn back thine ungodliness from thee,
  and thy fornication from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift up thine
  eyes upon them, and shalt no more remember Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Wherefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will
  deliver thee into the hands of those whom thou hatest, from whom thy soul is
  alienated. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they shall deal with
  thee in hatred, and shall take all the fruits of thy labours and thy toils,
  and thou shalt be naked and bare: and the shame of thy fornication shall be
  exposed: and thy ungodliness and thy fornication <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> brought this upon thee, in that thou wentest
  a-whoring after the nations, and didst defile thyself with their devices.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Thou didst walk in the way of thy
  sister; and I will put her cup into thine hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Thus saith the Lord; Drink thy sister’s cup, deep
  and large, and full, to cause complete drunkenness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And thou shalt be thoroughly weakened; and the
  cup of destruction, the cup of thy sister Samaria, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> drink thou it, and I will take away her feasts
  and her new moons: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord; Because thou has
  forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore receive thou the reward
  of thine ungodliness and thy fornication. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the Lord said to me, Son of man, wilt thou
  not judge Oola and Ooliba? and declare to them their iniquities? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For they have committed adultery, and blood was
  in their hands, they committed adultery with their devices, and they passed
  through the fire to them their children which they bore to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> So long too as they did these things to me, they
  defiled my sanctuary, and profaned my sabbaths. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And when they sacrificed their children to their
  idols, they also went into my sanctuary to profane it: and whereas they did
  thus in the midst of my house; <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> and
  whereas they did thus to the men that came from afar, to whom they sent
  messengers, and as soon as they came, immediately thou didst wash thyself,
  and didst paint thine eyes and adorn thyself with ornaments, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> and satest on a prepared bed, and before it there
  was a table set out, and as for mine incense and mine oil, they rejoiced in
  them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> and they raised a sound of
  music, and that with men coming from the wilderness out of a multitude of
  men, and they put bracelets on their hands, and a crown of glory on their
  heads; <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Therefore I said, Do they not
  commit adultery with these? and has she also gone a-whoring after the manner
  of a harlot? <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And they went in to her,
  as men go in to a harlot; so they went in to Oola and to Ooliba to work
  iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And they are just men, and
  shall take vengeance on them with the judgment of an adulteress and the
  judgment of blood: for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Thus saith the Lord God, Bring up a
  multitude upon them, and send trouble and plunder into the midst of them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And stone them with the stones of a
  multitude, and pierce them with their swords: they shall slay their sons and
  their daughters, and shall burn up their houses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And I will remove ungodliness out of the land,
  and all the women shall be instructed, and shall not do according to their
  ungodliness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And your ungodliness
  shall be recompensed upon you, and ye shall bear the guilt of your devices:
  and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel24">24</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, write for thyself
  daily from this day, on which the king of Babylon set himself against
  Jerusalem, even from this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  speak a parable to the provoking house, and thou shalt say to them,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and put the pieces into it, every
  prime piece, the leg and shoulder taken off from the bones, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> which are taken from choice cattle, and burn the
  bones under them: her bones are boiled and cooked in the midst of her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord; O
  bloody city, the caldron in which there is scum, and the scum has not gone
  out of, she has brought it forth piece by piece, no lot has fallen upon it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For her blood is in the midst of her;
  I have set it upon a smooth rock: I have not poured it out upon the earth, so
  that the earth should cover it; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> that
  my wrath should come up for complete vengeance to be taken: I set her blood
  upon a smooth rock, so as not to cover it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will also make
  the firebrand great, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and I will
  multiply the wood, and kindle the fire, that the flesh may be consumed, and
  the liquor boiled away; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and that it
  may stand upon the coals, that her brass may be thoroughly heated, and be
  melted in the midst of her filthiness, and her scum may be consumed,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and her abundant scum may not come
  forth of her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Her scum shall become
  shameful, because thou didst defile thyself: and what if thou shalt be purged
  no more until I have accomplished my wrath? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I the Lord have spoken; and it shall come, and I
  will do it; I will not delay, neither will I have any mercy: I will judge
  thee, saith the Lord, according to thy ways, and according to thy devices:
  therefore will I judge thee according to thy bloodshed, and according to thy
  devices will I judge thee, thou unclean, notorious, and abundantly provoking
  one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Son of man, behold I take
  from thee the desire of thine eyes by violence: thou shalt not lament,
  neither shalt thou weep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thou shalt
  groan for blood, and have mourning upon thy loins; thy hair shall not be
  braided upon thee, and thy sandals shall be on thy feet; thou shalt in no
  wise be comforted by their lips, and thou shalt not eat the bread of men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I spoke to the people in the
  morning, as he commanded me in the evening, and I did in the morning as it
  was commanded me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the people said
  to me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are that thou doest?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Then I said to them, The word of the
  Lord came to me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Say to the
  house of Israel, <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And ye shall do as I
  have done: ye shall not be comforted at their mouth, and ye shall not eat the
  bread of men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And your hair shall be
  upon your head, and your shoes on your feet: neither shall ye at all lament
  or weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and shall comfort every
  one his brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Jezekiel shall
  be for a sign to you: according to all that I have done shall ye do, when
  these things shall come; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day
  when I take their strength from them, the pride of their boasting, the
  desires of their eyes, and the pride of their soul, their sons and their
  daughters, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> that in that day he that
  escapes shall come to thee, to tell it thee in thine ears? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> In that day thy mouth shall be opened to him that
  escapes; thou shalt speak, and shalt be no longer dumb: and thou shalt be for
  a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel25">25</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, set thy face
  steadfastly against the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and thou shalt say to the children of
  Ammon, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> therefore, behold, I will
  deliver you to the children of Kedem for an inheritance, and they shall lodge
  in thee with their stuff, and they shall pitch their tents in thee: they
  shall eat thy fruits, and they shall drink thy milk. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I will give up the city of Ammon for camels’
  pastures, and the children of Ammon for a pasture of sheep: and ye shall know
  that I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For thus saith the
  Lord; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with thy foot, and
  heartily rejoiced against the land of Israel; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> therefore I will stretch out my hand against thee,
  and I will make thee a spoil to the nations; and I will utterly destroy thee
  from among the peoples, and I will completely cut thee off from out of the
  countries: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thus saith the Lord; Because Moab has said,
  Behold, are not the house of Israel and Juda like all the other nations?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore, behold, I will weaken the
  shoulder of Moab from his frontier cities, even the choice land, the house of
  Bethasimuth above the fountain of the city, by the sea-side. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I have given him the children of Kedem in
  addition to the children of Ammon for an inheritance, that there may be no
  remembrance of the children of Ammon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And I will execute vengeance on Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Thus saith the Lord; Because of what
  the Idumeans have done in taking vengeance on the house of Juda, and because
  they have remembered injuries, and have exacted full recompense; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> therefore thus saith the Lord; I will also
  stretch out my hand upon Idumea, and will utterly destroy out of it man and
  beast; and will make it desolate; and they that are pursued out of Thaeman
  shall fall by the sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will
  execute my vengeance on Idumea by the hand of my people Israel: and they
  shall deal in Idumea according to mine anger and according to my wrath, and
  they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because the
  Philistines have wrought revengefully, and raised up vengeance rejoicing from
  their heart to destroy the Israelites to a man; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will
  stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and will utterly destroy the
  Cretans, and will cut off the remnant that dwell by the sea-coast.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I will execute great vengeance

  vengeance upon them.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel26">26</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh
  year, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, because Sor has
  said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is crushed: the nations are destroyed: she
  is turned to me: she that was full is made desolate: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am
  against thee, O Sor, and I will bring up many nations against thee, as the
  sea comes up with its waves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they
  shall cast down the walls of Sor, and shall cast down thy towers: and I will
  scrape her dust from off her, and make her a bare rock. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for
  repairing nets: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord: and it shall be a spoil
  for the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And her daughters
  which are in the field shall be slain with the sword, and they shall know
  that I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For thus saith the
  Lord; Behold, I will bring up against thee, O Sor, Nabuchodonosor king of
  Babylon from the north: he is a king of kings, with horses, and chariots, and
  horsemen, and a concourse of very many nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He shall slay thy daughters that are in the field
  with the sword, and shall set a watch against thee, and build forts around
  thee, and carry a rampart round against thee, and set up warlike works, and
  array his spears against thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He
  shall cast down with his swords thy walls and thy towers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> By reason of thy multitude of his horses their
  dust shall cover thee, and by reason of the sound of his horsemen and the
  wheels of his chariots the walls shall be shaken, when he enters into thy
  gates, as one entering into a city from the plain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> With the hoofs of his horses they shall trample
  all thy streets: he shall slay thy people with the sword, and shall bring
  down to the ground the support of thy strength. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he shall prey upon thy power, and plunder thy
  substance, and shall cast down thy walls, and break down thy pleasant houses:
  and he shall cast thy stones and thy timber and thy dust into the midst of
  thy sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he shall destroy the
  multitude of thy musicians, and the sound of thy psalteries shall be heard no
  more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will make thee a bare
  rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more:
  for I the Lord have spoken it, saith the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For thus saith the Lord God to Sor; Shall not the
  isles shake at the sound of thy fall, while the wounded are groaning, while
  they have drawn a sword in the midst of thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And all the princes of the nations of the sea
  shall come down from their thrones, and shall take off their crowns from
  their heads, and shall take off their embroidered raiment: they shall be
  utterly amazed; they shall sit upon the ground, and fear their own
  destruction, and shall groan over thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they shall take up a lamentation for thee,
  and shall say to thee, How art thou destroyed from out of the sea, the
  renowned city, that brought her terror upon all her inhabitants. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the isles shall be alarmed at the day of thy
  fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For thus saith the Lord God;
  When I shall make the city desolate, as the cities that shall not be
  inhabited, when I have brought the deep up upon thee, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and great waters shall cover thee; and I shall
  bring thee down to them that go down to the pit, to the people of old time,
  and shall cause thee to dwell in the depths of the earth, as in everlasting
  desolation, with them that go down to the pit, that thou mayest not be
  inhabited, nor stand upon the land of life; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I will make thee a destruction, and thou shalt be
  no more for ever, saith the Lord God.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel27">27</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And thou, son of man, take up
  a lamentation against Sor; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and thou
  shalt say to Sor that dwells at the entrance of the sea, to the mart of the
  nations coming from many islands, Thus saith the Lord to Sor; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> In the heart of the sea thy sons have put beauty
  upon thee for Beelim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Cedar in Senir
  was employed for thee in building: boards of cypress timber were taken out of
  Libanus, and wood to make thee masts of fir. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> They made thine oars of wood out of the land of
  Basan; thy sacred utensils they made of ivory, thy shady houses of wood from
  the isles of Chetiim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Fine linen with
  embroidery from Egypt supplied the couch, to put honour upon thee, and to
  clothe thee with blue and purple from the isles of Elisai; and they became
  thy coverings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And thy princes were
  the dwellers in Sidon, and the Aradians were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Sor,
  who were in thee, these were thy pilots. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The elders of the Biblians, and their wise men,
  who were in thee, these helped thy counsel: and all the ships of the sea and
  their rowers traded for thee to the utmost west. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Persians and Lydians and Libyans were in thine
  army: thy warriors hung in thee shields and helmets; these gave thee thy
  glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The sons of the Aradians and
  thine army were upon the walls; there were guards in thy towers: they hung
  their quivers on thy battlements round about; these completed thy beauty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The Carthaginians were thy merchants
  because of the abundance of all thy strength; they furnished thy market with
  silver, and gold, and iron, and tin, and lead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Greece, both the whole world, and the adjacent
  coasts, these traded with thee in the persons of men, and they gave as thy
  merchandise vessels of brass. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Out of
  the house of Thogarma horses and horsemen furnished the market. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The sons of the Rhodians were thy merchants; from
  the islands they multiplied thy merchandise, even elephants’ teeth: and to
  them that came in thou didst return thy prices, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> even men as thy merchandise, from the multitude
  of thy trading population, myrrh and embroidered works from Tharsis: Ramoth
  also and Chorchor furnished thy market. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Juda and the children of Israel, these were thy
  merchants; in the sale of corn and ointments and cassia: and they gave the
  best honey, and oil, and resin, to thy trading population. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The people of Damascus were thy merchants by
  reason of the abundance of all thy power; wine out of Chelbon, and wool from
  Miletus; and they brought wine into thy market. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Out of Asel came wrought iron, and there is the
  sound of wheels among thy trading population. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The people of Daedan were thy merchants, with
  choice cattle for chariots. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Arabia
  and all the princes of Kedar, these were thy traders with thee, bringing
  camels, and lambs, and rams, in which they trade with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The merchants of Sabba and Ramma, these were thy
  merchants, with choice spices, and precious stones: and they brought gold to
  thy market. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Charra, and Chanaa, these
  were thy merchants: Assur, and Charman, were thy merchants: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> bringing for merchandise blue, and choice stores
  bound with cords, and cypress wood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  Ships were thy merchants, in abundance, with thy trading population: and thou
  wast filled and very heavily loaded in the heart of the sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters:
  the south wind has broken thee in the heart of the sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Thy forces, and thy gain, and that of thy
  traders, and thy rowers, and thy pilots, and thy counselors, and they that
  traffic with thee, and all thy warriors that are in thee: and all thy company
  in the midst of thee shall perish in the heart of the sea, in the day of thy
  fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> At the cry of thy voice thy
  pilots shall be greatly terrified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  And all the rowers and the mariners shall come down from the ships, and the
  pilots of the sea shall stand on the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And they shall wail over thee with their voice,
  and cry bitterly, and put earth on their heads, and spread ashes under them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And their sons shall take up a lament for thee,
  even a lamentation for Sor, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  How large a reward hast thou gained from the sea? thou hast filled nations
  out of thine abundance; and out of thy mixed merchandise thou hast enriched
  all the kings of the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Now art
  thou broken in the sea, thy traders are in the deep water, and all thy
  company in the midst of thee: all thy rowers have fallen. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> All the dwellers in the islands have mourned over
  thee, and their kings have been utterly amazed, and their countenance has
  wept. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Merchants from the nations have
  hissed at thee; thou art utterly destroyed, and shalt not be any more for
  ever.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel28">28</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And thou, son of man, say
  to the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord; Because thine heart has been
  exalted, and thou hast said, I am God, I have inhabited the dwelling of God
  in the heart of the sea; yet thou art man and not God, though thou hast set
  thine heart as the heart of God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> art
  thou wiser than Daniel? or have not the wise instructed thee with their
  knowledge? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Hast thou gained power for
  thyself by thine own knowledge or thine own prudence, and gotten gold and
  silver in thy treasures? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> By thy
  abundant knowledge and thy traffic thou hast multiplied thy power; thy heart
  has been lifted up by thy power. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Since thou hast set thine heart as the hart of
  God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> because of this, behold, I will
  bring on thee strange plagues from the nations; and they shall draw their
  swords against thee, and against the beauty of thy knowledge, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and they shall bring down thy beauty to
  destruction. And they shall bring thee down; and thou shalt die the death of
  the slain in the heart of the sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Wilt thou indeed say, I am God, before them that slay thee? whereas thou art
  man, and not God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thou shalt perish
  by the hands of strangers among the multitude of the uncircumcised: for I
  have spoken it, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  the word of the Lord came to me, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Son of man, take up a lamentation for the prince
  of Tyre, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou art a seal of
  resemblance, and crown of beauty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Thou wast in the delight of the paradise of God; thou hast bound upon thee
  every precious stone, the sardius, and topaz, and emerald, and carbuncle, and
  sapphire, and jasper, and silver, and gold, and ligure, and agate, and
  amethyst, and chrysolite, and beryl, and onyx: and thou hast filled thy
  treasures and thy stores in thee with gold. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> From the day that thou wast created thou wast
  with the cherub: I set thee on the holy mount of God; thou wast in the midst
  of the stones of fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thou wast
  faultless in thy days, from the day that thou wast created, until iniquity
  was found in thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Of the abundance
  of thy merchandise thou hast filled thy storehouses with iniquity, and hast
  sinned: therefore thou hast been cast down wounded from the mount of God, and
  the cherub has brought thee out of the midst of the stones of fire.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thy heart has been lifted up because
  of thy beauty; thy knowledge has been corrupted with thy beauty: because of
  the multitude of thy sins I have cast thee to the ground, I have caused thee
  to be put to open shame before kings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  Because of the multitude of thy sins and the iniquities of thy merchandise, I
  have profaned thy sacred things; and I will bring fire out of the midst of
  thee, this shall devour thee; and I will make thee to be ashes upon thy land
  before all that see thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And all
  that know thee among the nations shall groan over thee: thou art gone to
  destruction, and thou shalt not exist any more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Son of man, set thy face against
  Sidon, and prophesy against it, <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and
  say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be
  glorified in thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, when I have
  wrought judgments in thee, and I will be sanctified in thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Blood and death shall be in thy streets; and men
  wounded with swords shall fall in thee and on every side of thee; and they
  shall know that I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  there shall no more be in the house of Israel a thorn of bitterness and a
  pricking briar proceeding from them that are round about them, who
  dishonoured them; and they shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Thus saith the Lord God; I will also gather
  Israel from the nations, among whom they have been scattered, and I will be
  sanctified among them, and before the peoples and nations: and they shall
  dwell upon their land, which I gave to my servant Jacob. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Yea, they shall dwell upon it safely, and they
  shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell securely, when I shall
  execute judgment on all that have dishonoured them, even on those that are
  round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and the
  God of their fathers.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel29">29</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the twelfth year, in the tenth
  month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, set thy face
  against Pharao king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against the whole
  of Egypt: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and say, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause
  the fish of thy river to stick to thy sides, and I will bring thee up out of
  the midst of thy river: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and I will
  quickly cast down thee and all the fish of thy river: thou shalt fall on the
  face of the plain, and shalt by no means be gathered, and shalt not be
  brought together: I have given thee for food to the wild beasts of the earth
  and to the fowls of the sky. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And all
  the dwellers in Egypt shall know that I am the Lord, because thou hast been a
  staff of reed to the house of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  When they took hold of thee with their hand, thou didst break: and when every
  hand was clapped against them, and when they leaned on thee, thou wast
  utterly broken, and didst crush the loins of them all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will
  bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and the land of Egypt shall be ruined
  and desert; and they shall know that I am the Lord; because thou sayest, The
  rivers are mine, and I made them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  Therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against all thy rivers, and I will
  give up the land of Egypt to desolation, and the sword, and destruction, from
  Magdol and Syene even to the borders of the Ethiopians. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> No foot of man shall pass through it, and no foot
  of beast shall pass through it, and it shall not be inhabited for forty
  years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I will cause her land to
  be utterly destroyed in the midst of a land that is desolate, and her cities
  shall be desolate forty years in the midst of cities that are desolate: and I
  will disperse Egypt among the nations, and will utterly scatter them into the
  countries. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thus saith the Lord; After
  forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations among whom they have
  been scattered; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and I will turn the
  captivity of the Egyptians, and will cause them to dwell in the land of
  Phathore, in the land whence they were taken; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and it shall be a base kingdom beyond all other
  kingdoms; it shall not any more be exalted over the nations; and I will make
  them few in number, that they may not be great among the nations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they shall no more be to the
  house of Israel a confidence bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they
  follow after them; and they shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year,
  on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Son of man, Nabuchodonosor king of
  Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was
  bald, and every shoulder peeled; yet there was no reward to him or to his
  army serving against Tyre, nor for the service wherewith they served against
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thus saith the Lord God; Behold,
  I will give to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon the land of Egypt, and he shall
  take the plunder thereof, and seize the spoils thereof; and it shall be a
  reward for his army. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> In return for
  his service wherewith he served against Tyre, I have given him the land of
  Egypt; thus saith the Lord God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> In
  that day shall a horn spring forth for all the house of Israel, and I will
  give thee an open mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am
  the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel30">30</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, prophesy, and
  say, Thus saith the Lord; Woe, woe worth the day! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the day of the Lord is nigh, a day of cloud;
  it shall be the end of the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And the sword shall come upon the Egyptians, and there shall be tumult in
  Ethiopia, and in Egypt men shall fall down slain together, and her
  foundations shall fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Persians, and
  Cretans, and Lydians, and Libyans, and all the mixed multitude, and they of
  the children of my covenant, shall fall by the sword therein. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the supports of Egypt shall fall; and the
  pride of her strength shall come down from Magdol to Syene: they shall fall
  by the sword in it, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And it shall be made desolate in the midst of desolate countries, and their
  cities shall be desolate in the midst of desolate cities: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I
  shall send fire upon Egypt, and when all that help her shall be broken.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> In that day shall messengers go forth
  hasting to destroy Ethiopia utterly, and there shall be tumult among them in
  the day of Egypt: for, behold it comes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thus saith the Lord God; I will also destroy the
  multitude of the Egyptians by the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> his hand and his people’s; they are
  plagues sent forth from the nations to destroy the land: and they all shall
  unsheath their swords against Egypt, and the land shall be filled with slain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I will make their rivers
  desolate, and will destroy the land and the fulness of it by the hands of
  strangers: I the Lord have spoken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  For thus saith the Lord God; I will also destroy the nobles from Memphis, and
  the princes of Memphis out of the land of Egypt; and they shall be no more.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will destroy the land of
  Phathore, and will send fire upon Tanis, and will execute vengeance on
  Diospolis. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I will pour out my
  wrath upon Sais the strength of Egypt, and will destroy the multitude of
  Memphis. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I will send fire upon
  Egypt; and Syene shall be sorely troubled; and there shall be a breaking in
  Diospolis, and waters shall be poured out. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The youths of Heliopolis and Bubastum shall fall
  by the sword, and the women shall go into captivity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the day shall be darkened in Taphnae, when I
  have broken there the scepters of Egypt: and the pride of her strength shall
  perish there: and a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall be taken
  prisoners. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I will execute
  judgment on Egypt; and they shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the
  first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Son of man, I have broken
  the arms of Pharao, king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up to
  be healed, to have a plaster put upon it, or to be strengthened to lay hold
  of the sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore thus saith
  the Lord God; Behold, I am against Pharao king of Egypt, and I will break his
  strong and outstretched arms, and will smite down his sword out of his hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I will disperse the Egyptians
  among the nations, and will utterly scatter them among the countries.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And I will strengthen the arms of the
  king of Babylon, and put my sword into his hand: and he shall bring it upon
  Egypt, and shall take her plunder and seize her spoils. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Yea, I will strengthen the arms of the king of
  Babylon, and the arms of Pharao shall fail: and they shall know that I am the
  Lord, when I have put my sword into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he
  shall stretch it out over the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And I will disperse the Egyptians among the
  nations, and utterly scatter them among the countries; and they all shall
  know that I am the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel31">31</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh
  year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord
  came to me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, say to
  Pharao king of Egypt, and to his multitude; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Behold, the Assyrian was a cypress in Libanus, and
  was fair in shoots, and high in stature: his top reached to the midst of the
  clouds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The water nourished him, the
  depth made him grow tall; she led her rivers round about his plants, and she
  sent forth her streams to all the trees of the field. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Therefore was his stature exalted above all the
  trees of the field, and his branches spread far by the help of much water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> All the birds of the sky made their
  nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the wild beasts of the field
  bred; the whole multitude of nations dwelt under his shadow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he was fair in his height by reason of the
  multitude of his branches: for his roots were amidst much water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And such cypresses as this were in the paradise of
  God; and there were no pines like his shoots, and there were no firs like his
  branches: no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his beauty,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> because of the multitude of his
  branches: and the trees of God’s paradise of delight envied him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord; Because thou art
  grown great, and hast set thy top in the midst of the clouds, and I saw when
  he was exalted; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> therefore I delivered
  him into the hands of the prince of the nations, and he wrought his
  destruction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And ravaging strangers
  from the nations have destroyed him, and have cast him down upon the
  mountains: his branches fell in all the valleys, and his boughs were broken
  in every field of the land; and all the people of the nations are gone down
  from their shelter, and have laid him low. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> All the birds of the sky have settled on his
  fallen trunk, and all the wild beasts of the field came upon his boughs:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> in order that none of the trees by
  the water should exalt themselves by reason of their size: whereas they set
  their top in the midst of the clouds, yet they continued not in their high
  state in their place, all that drank water, all were consigned to death, to
  the depth of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that
  go down to the pit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord God; In the day wherein he went down to Hades, the deep mourned for him:
  and I stayed her floods, and restrained her abundance of water: and Libanus
  saddened for him, all the trees of the field fainted for him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> At the sound of his fall the nations quaked, when
  I brought him down to Hades with them that go down to the pit: and all the
  trees of Delight comforted him in the heart, and the choice of plants of
  Libanus, all that drink water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For
  they went down to hell with him among the slain with the sword; and his seed,
  even they that dwelt under his shadow, perished in the midst of their life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> To whom art thou compared? descend,
  and be thou debased with the trees of paradise to the depth of the earth:
  thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by
  the sword. Thus shall Pharao be, and the multitude of his host, saith the
  Lord God.</p>

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I will cast thy flesh upon the
  mountains, and will saturate them with thy blood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the land shall be drenched with thy dung,
  because of thy multitude upon the mountains: I will fill the valleys with
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will veil the heavens when
  thou art extinguished, and will darken the stars thereof; I will cover the
  sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> All the bodies that give light in the sky, shall
  be darkened over thee, and I will bring darkness upon the earth, saith the
  Lord God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I will provoke to anger
  the heart of many people, when I shall lead thee captive among the nations,
  to a land which thou hast not known. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And many nations shall mourn over thee, and their kings shall be utterly
  amazed, when my sword flies in their faces, as they wait for their own fall
  from the day of thy fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For thus
  saith the Lord God; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> with the swords of mighty men; and I
  will cast down thy strength: they are all destroying ones from the nations,
  and they shall destroy the pride of Egypt, and all her strength shall be
  crushed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I will destroy all her
  cattle from beside the great water; and the foot of man shall not trouble it
  any more, and the step of cattle shall no more trample it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thus shall their waters then be at rest, and
  their rivers shall flow like oil, saith the Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> when I shall give up Egypt to destruction, and
  the land shall be made desolate with the fullness thereof; when I shall
  scatter all that dwell in it, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> There is a lamentation, and thou
  shalt utter it; and the daughters of the nations shall utter it, even for
  Egypt, and they shall mourn for it over all the strength thereof, saith the
  Lord God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it came to pass in the
  twelfth year, in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word
  of the Lord came to me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Son
  of man, lament over the strength of Egypt, for the nations shall bring down
  her daughters dead to the depth of the earth, to them that go down to the
  pit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> They shall fall with him in the midst of them
  that are slain with the sword, and all his strength shall perish: the giants
  also shall say to thee, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Be thou in
  the depth of the pit: to whom art thou superior? yea, go down, and lie with
  the uncircumcised, in the midst of them that are slain with the sword.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> There are Assur and all his company:
  all his slain have been laid there: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  and their burial is in the depth of the pit, and his company are set around
  about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, who had caused the fear
  of them to be upon the land of the living. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> There is Ælam and all his host round about his
  tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, and the uncircumcised that go
  down to the deep of the earth, who caused their fear to be upon the land of
  the living: and they have received their punishment with them that go down to
  the pit, <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> in the midst of the slain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> There were laid Mosoch, and Thobel,
  and all his strength round about his tomb: all his slain men, all the
  uncircumcised, slain with the sword, who caused their fear to be in the land
  of the living. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they are laid with
  the giants that fell of old, who went down to Hades with their weapons of
  war: and they laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities were
  upon their bones, because they terrified all men during their life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And thou shalt lie in the midst of
  the uncircumcised, with them that have been slain by the sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> There are laid the princes of Assur, who yielded
  their strength to a wound of the sword: these are laid with the slain, with
  them that go down to the pit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> There
  are the princes of the north, even all the captains of Assur, who go down
  slain to Hades: they lie uncircumcised among the slain with the sword
  together with their terror and their strength, and they have received their
  punishment with them that go down to the pit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> King Pharao shall see them, and shall be
  comforted over all their force, saith the Lord God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For I have caused his fear to be upon the land of
  the living yet he shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that
  are slain with the sword, even Pharao, and all his multitude with him, saith
  the Lord God.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel33">33</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, speak to the
  children of thy people, and thou shalt say to them, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and he shall see the sword coming upon the land,
  and blow the trumpet, and sound an alarm to the people; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and he that hears the sound of the trumpet shall
  hear indeed, and yet not take heed, and the sword shall come upon him, and
  overtake him, his blood shall be upon his own head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Because he heard the sound of the trumpet, and
  took no heed, his blood shall be upon him: but the other, because he took
  heed, has delivered his soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But if
  the watchman see the sword coming, and do not sound the trumpet, and the
  people do not watch; and the sword come, and take a soul from among them,
  that soul is taken because of its iniquity; but the blood thereof will I
  require at the watchman’s hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  thou, son of man, I have set thee as a watchman to the house of Israel, and
  thou shalt hear a word from my mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  When I say to the sinner, Thou shalt surely die; if thou speak not to warn
  the wicked from his way, the wicked himself shall die in his iniquity; but
  his blood will I require at thine hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But if thou forewarn the wicked of his way to turn
  from it, and he turn not from his way, he shall die in his ungodliness; but
  thou hast delivered thine own soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And thou, son of man, say to the house of Israel; Thus have ye spoken,
  saying, Our errors, and our iniquities weigh upon us, and we pine away in
  them, and how then shall we live? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Say
  to them, Thus saith the Lord; As I live, I desire not the death of the
  ungodly, as that the ungodly should turn from his way and live: turn ye
  heartily from your way; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Say to the children of thy people, The
  righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him, in the day wherein he
  errs: and the iniquity of the ungodly shall not harm him, in the day wherein
  he turns from his iniquity, but the righteous erring shall not be able to
  deliver himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> When I say to the
  righteous, Thou shalt live; and he trusts in his righteousness, and shall
  commit iniquity, none of his righteousnesses shall be remembered; in his
  unrighteousness which he has wrought, in it shall he die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And when I say to the ungodly, Thou shalt surely
  die; and he shall turn from his sin, and do judgment and justice,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and return the pledge, and repay that
  which he has robbed, and walk in the ordinances of life, so as to do no
  wrong; he shall surely live, and shall not die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> None of his sins which he has committed shall be
  remembered: because he has wrought judgment and righteousness; by them shall
  he live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Yet the children of thy
  people will say, The way of the Lord is not straight: whereas this their way
  is not straight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> When the righteous
  turns away from his righteousness, and shall commit iniquities, then shall he
  die in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And when the sinner
  turns from his iniquity, and shall do judgment and righteousness, he shall
  live by them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And this is that which
  ye said, The way of the Lord is not straight. I will judge you, O house of
  Israel, every one for his ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  it came to pass in the tenth year of our captivity, in the twelfth month, on
  the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped from Jerusalem came to
  me, saying, The city is taken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Now
  the hand of the Lord had come upon me in the evening, before he came; and he
  opened my mouth, when he came to me in the morning: and my mouth was open, it
  was no longer kept closed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the
  word of the Lord came to me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Son of man, they that inhabit the desolate places on the land of Israel say,
  Abram was one, and he possessed the land: and we are more numerous; to us the
  land is given for a possession. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord God,
  As I live, surely they that are in the desolate places shall fall by swords
  and they that are in the open plain shall be given for food to the wild
  beasts of the field, and them that are in the fortified cities and them that
  are in the caves I will slay with pestilence. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And I will make the land desert, and the pride of
  her strength shall perish; and the mountains of Israel shall be made desolate
  by reason of no man passing through. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  And they shall know that I am the Lord; and I will make their land desert,
  and it shall be made desolate because of all their abominations which they
  have wrought. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And as for thee, son of
  man, the children of thy people are they that speak concerning thee by the
  walls, and in the porches of the houses, and they talk one to another,
  saying, Let us come together, and let us hear the words that proceed from the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> They approach thee as a people
  comes together, and sit before thee, and hear thy words, but they will not do
  them: for there is falsehood in their mouth, and their heart goes after their
  pollutions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And thou art to them as a
  sound of a sweet, well-tuned psaltery, and they will hear thy words, but they
  will not do them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But whenever it
  shall come to pass, they will say, Behold, it is come: and they shall know
  that there was a prophet in the midst of them.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel34">34</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, prophesy
  against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to the shepherds,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Behold, ye feed on the milk, and
  clothe yourselves with the wool, and slay the fat: but ye feed not my sheep.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The weak one ye have not strengthened,
  and the sick ye have not cherished, and the bruised ye have not bound up, and
  the stray one ye have not turned back, and the lost ye have not sought; and
  the strong ye have wearied with labour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And my sheep were scattered, because there were no
  shepherds: and they became meat to all the wild beasts of the field.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And my sheep were scattered on every
  mountain, and on every high hill: yea, they were scattered on the face of the
  earth, and there was none to seek them out, nor to bring them back.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word
  of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> As I live, saith the Lord
  God, surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became meat to all
  the wild beasts of the field, because there were no shepherds, and the
  shepherds sought not out my sheep, and the shepherds fed themselves, but fed
  not my sheep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For this cause, O
  shepherds, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> thus saith the Lord God,
  Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their
  hands, and will turn them back that they shall not feed my sheep, and the
  shepherds shall no longer feed them; and I will deliver my sheep out of their
  mouth, and they shall no longer be meat for them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will seek
  out my sheep, and will visit them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> As
  the shepherd seeks his flock, in the day when there is darkness and cloud, in
  the midst of the sheep that are separated: so will I seek out my sheep, and
  will bring them back from every place where they were scattered in the day of
  cloud and darkness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I will bring
  them out from the Gentiles, and will gather them from the countries, and will
  bring them into their own land, and will feed them upon the mountains of
  Israel, and in the valleys, and in every inhabited place of the land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I will feed them in a good pasture,
  on a high mountain of Israel: and their folds shall be there, and they shall
  lie down, and there shall they rest in perfect prosperity, and they shall
  feed in a fat pasture on the mountains of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to
  rest; and they shall know that I am the Lord: thus saith the Lord God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I will seek that which is lost, and I
  will recover the stray one, and will bind up that which was broken, and will
  strengthen the fainting, and will guard the strong, and will feed them with
  judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And as for you, ye sheep,
  thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will distinguish between sheep and sheep,
  between rams and he-goats. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And is it
  not enough for you that ye fed on the good pasture, that ye trampled with
  your feet the remnant of your pasture? and that ye drank the standing water,
  that ye disturbed the residue with your feet? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> So my sheep fed on that which ye had trampled
  with your feet; and they drank the water that had been disturbed by your
  feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord
  God; Behold, I will separate between the strong sheep and the weak sheep.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Ye did thrust with your sides and
  shoulders, and pushed with your horns, and ye cruelly treated all the sick.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore I will save my sheep, and
  they shall not be any more for a prey; and will judge between ram and ram.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I will raise up one shepherd over
  them, and he shall tend them, even my servant David, and he shall be their
  shepherd; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and I the Lord will be to
  them a God, and David a prince in the midst of them; I the Lord have spoken
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And I will make with David a
  covenant of peace and I will utterly destroy evil beasts from off the land;
  and they shall dwell in the wilderness, and sleep in the forests.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And I will settle them round about my
  mountain; and I will give you the rain, the rain of blessing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the trees that are in the field shall yield
  their fruit, and the earth shall yield her strength, and they shall dwell in
  the confidence of peace on their land, and they shall know that I am the
  Lord, when I have broken their yoke; and I will deliver them out of the hand
  of those that enslaved them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And they
  shall no more be a spoil to the nations, and the wild beasts of the land
  shall no more at all devour them; and they shall dwell safely, and there
  shall be none to make them afraid. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  And I will raise up for them a plant of peace, and they shall no more perish
  with hunger upon the land, and they shall no more bear the reproach of the
  nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And they shall know that I
  am the Lord their God, and they my people. O house of Israel, saith the Lord
  God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> ye are my sheep, even the sheep
  of my flock, and I am the Lord your God, saith the Lord God.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel35">35</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Son of man, set thy face

  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and say to it, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I will cause desolation in thy cities, and
  thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Because thou hast been a perpetual enemy, and hast
  laid wait craftily for the house of Israel, with the hand of enemies with a
  sword, in the time of injustice, at the last: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, verily
  thou hast sinned even to blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will make mount Seir a waste,
  and desolate, and I will destroy from off it men and cattle: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and I will fill thy hills and thy valleys with
  slain men, and in all thy plains there shall fall in thee men slain with the
  sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I will make thee a perpetual
  desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited any more: and thou shalt
  know that I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Because thou
  saidst, The two nations and the two countries shall be mine, and I shall
  inherit them; whereas the Lord is there: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> therefore, as I live, saith the Lord, I will even
  deal with thee according to thine enmity, and I will be made known to thee
  when I shall judge thee: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and thou
  shalt know that I am the Lord. I have heard the voice of thy blasphemies,
  whereas thou hast said, The desert mountains of Israel are given to us for
  food; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and thou hast spoken swelling
  words against me with thy mouth: I have heard them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thus saith the Lord; When all the earth is
  rejoicing, I will make thee desert. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Thou shalt be desert, O mount Seir, and all Idumea; and it shall be utterly
  consumed: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord their God.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel36">36</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And thou, son of man, prophesy to
  the mountains of Israel, and say to the mountains of Israel, Hear ye the word
  of the Lord: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Thus saith the Lord God;
  Because the enemy has said against you, Aha, the old waste places are become
  a possession for us: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> therefore
  prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have been dishonoured,
  and hated by those round about you, that ye might be a possession to the
  remainder of the nations, and ye became a by-word, and a reproach to the
  nations: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> therefore, ye mountains of
  Israel, hear the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord to the mountains, and
  to the hills, and to the streams, and to the valleys, and to the places that
  have been made desolate and destroyed, and to the cities that have been
  deserted, and have become a spoil and a trampling to the nations that were
  left round about; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> therefore, thus
  saith the Lord; Verily in the fire of my wrath have I spoken against the rest
  of the nations, and against all Idumea, because they have appropriated my
  land to themselves for a possession with joy, disregarding the lives of the
  inhabitants, to destroy it by plunder: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains,
  and to the hills, and to the valleys, and to the forests, Thus saith the
  Lord; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have
  borne the reproaches of the heathen: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  therefore I will lift up my hand against the nations that are round about
  you; they shall bear their reproach. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  But your grapes and your fruits, O mountains of Israel, shall my people eat;
  for they are hoping to come. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For,
  behold, I am toward you, and I will have respect to you, and ye shall be
  tilled and sown: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and I will multiply
  men upon you, even all the house of Israel to the end: and the cities shall
  be inhabited, and the desolate land shall be built upon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I will multiply men and cattle upon you; and
  I will cause you to dwell as at the beginning, and will treat you well, as in
  your former times: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I will increase men upon you, even my people
  Israel; and they shall inherit you, and ye shall be to them for a possession;
  and ye shall no more be bereaved of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thus saith the Lord God: Because they said to
  thee, Thou land devourest men, and hast been bereaved of thy nation;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> therefore thou shalt no more devour
  men, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nation, saith the Lord God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And there shall no more be heard
  against you the reproach of the nations, and ye shall no more bear the
  revilings of the peoples, saith the Lord God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Son of man, the house of Israel dwelt
  upon their land, and defiled it by their way, and with their idols, and with
  their uncleannesses; and their way was before me like the uncleanness of a
  removed woman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> So I poured out my
  wrath upon them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and I dispersed them
  among the nations, and utterly scattered them through the countries: I judged
  them according to their way and according to their sin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they went in among the nations, among which
  they went, and they profaned my holy name, while it was said of them, These
  are the people of the Lord, and they came forth out of his land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But I spared them for the sake of my holy name,
  which the house of Israel profaned among the nations, among whom they went.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore say to the house of Israel,
  Thus saith the Lord; I do not this, O house of Israel, for your sakes, but
  because of my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, among whom
  ye went. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I will sanctify my great
  name, which was profaned among the nations, which ye profaned in the midst of
  them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, when I am sanctified
  among you before their eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And I
  will take you out from the nations, and will gather you out of all the lands,
  and will bring you into your own land: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye
  shall be purged from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols, and I
  will cleanse you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And I will give you
  a new heart, and will put a new spirit in you: and I will take away the heart
  of stone out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And I will put my Spirit in you, and will cause
  you to walk in mine ordinances, and to keep my judgments, and do them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And ye shall dwell upon the land
  which I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be to me a people, and I will be
  to you a God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And I will save you
  from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and multiply it,
  and will not bring famine upon you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  And I will multiply the fruit of the trees, and the produce of the field,
  that ye may not bear the reproach of famine among the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And ye shall remember your evil ways and your
  practices that were not good, and ye shall be hateful in your own sight for
  your transgressions and for your abominations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God,
  as it is known to you: be ye ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Thus saith the Lord God; In
  the day wherein I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also
  cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built upon:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> and the desolate land shall be
  cultivated, whereas it was desolate in the eyes of every one that passed by.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And they shall say, That desolate
  land is become like a garden of delight; and the waste and desolate and
  ruined cities are inhabited. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the
  nations, as many as shall have been left round about you, shall know that I
  the Lord have built the ruined cities and planted the waste lands: I the Lord
  have spoken, and will do it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Thus
  saith the Lord God; Yet for this will I be sought by the house of Israel, to
  establish them; I will multiply them even men as sheep; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> as holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her
  feasts; thus shall the desert cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall
  know that I am the Lord.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the hand of the Lord came upon
  me, and the Lord brought me forth by the Spirit, and set me in the midst of
  the plain, and it was full of human bones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he led me round about them every way: and,
  behold, there were very many on the face of the plain, very dry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he said to me, Son of man, will these bones
  live? and I said, O Lord God, thou knowest this. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he said to me, Prophesy upon these bones, and
  thou shalt say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus saith the Lord to these bones; Behold, I will
  bring upon you the breath of life: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and
  I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and will spread
  skin upon you, and will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and ye
  shall know that I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> So I
  prophesied as the Lord commanded me: and it came to pass while I was
  prophesying, that, behold, there was a shaking, and the bones approached each
  one to his joint. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I looked, and
  behold, sinews and flesh grew upon them, and skin came upon them above: but
  there was not breath in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he
  said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind,
  Thus saith the Lord; Come from the four winds, and breathe upon these dead
  men, and let them live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> So I
  prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath entered into them, and they
  lived, and stood upon their feet, a very great congregation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Lord spoke to me, saying, Son of man,
  these bones are the whole house of Israel: and they say, Our bones are become
  dry, our hope has perished, we are quite spent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord;
  Behold, I will open your tombs, and will bring you up out of your tombs, and
  will bring you into the land of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have
  opened your graves, that I may bring up my people from their graves.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will put my Spirit within you,
  and ye shall live, and I will place you upon your own land: and ye shall know
  that I am the Lord; I have spoken, and will do it, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Son of man, take for thyself
  a rod, and write upon it, Juda, and the children of Israel his adherents; and
  thou shalt take for thyself another rod, and thou shalt inscribe it for
  Joseph, the rod of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel that belong to
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And thou shalt joint them
  together for thyself, so as that they should bind themselves into one stick;
  and they shall be in thine hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  it shall come to pass, when the children of thy people shall say to thee,
  Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these things? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the Lord;
  behold, I will take the tribe of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and
  the tribes of Israel that belong to him, and I will add them to the tribe of
  Juda, and they shall become one rod in the hand of Juda. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the rods on which thou didst write shall be
  in thine hand in their presence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the
  whole house of Israel out of the midst of the nations, among whom they have
  gone, and I will gather them from all that are round about them, and I will
  bring them into the land of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And I will make them a nation in my land, even on the mountains of Israel;
  and they shall have one prince: and they shall be no more two nations,
  neither shall they be divided any more at all into two kingdoms: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> that they may no more defile themselves with
  their idols; and I will deliver them from all their transgressions whereby
  they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be to me a people,
  and I the Lord will be to them a God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And my servant David shall be a prince in the midst of them: there shall be
  one shepherd of them all; for they shall walk in mine ordinances, and keep my
  judgments, and do them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they
  shall dwell in their land, which I have given to my servant Jacob, where
  their fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell upon it: and David my servant shall
  be their prince forever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And I will
  make with them a covenant of peace; it shall be an everlasting covenant with
  them; and I will establish my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And my tabernacle shall be among
  them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be my people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the nations shall know that I am the Lord
  that sanctifies them, when my sanctuary is in the midst of them for ever.</p>

  prophesy against him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and say to him,
  Thus saith the Lord God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and I will
  gather thee, and all thine host, horses and horsemen, all wearing
  breast-plates, with a great multitude, shields and helmets and swords:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Persians, and Ethiopians, and Libyans;
  all with helmets and shields. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Gomer,

  thy multitude that is assembled with thee, and thou shalt be to me for a

  out of the nations, and they shall all dwell securely. <span style=

  a cloud to cover the land, and there shall be thou, and all that are about
  thee, and many nations with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  Thus saith the Lord God; It shall also come to pass in that day, that
  thoughts shall come up into thine heart, and thou shalt devise evil devices.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou shalt say, I will go up to
  the rejected land; I will come upon them that are at ease in tranquility, and
  dwelling in peace, all inhabiting a land in which there is no wall, nor bars,
  nor have they doors; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> to seize
  plunder, and to take their spoil; to turn my hands against the desolate land
  that is now inhabited, and against a nation that is gathered from many
  nations, that have acquired property, dwelling in the midst of the land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Sabba, and Daedan, and Carthaginian
  merchants, and all their villages shall say to thee, Thou art come for
  plunder to take a prey, and to get spoils: thou hast gathered thy multitude
  to take silver and gold, to carry off property, to take spoils. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog,
  Thus saith the Lord; Wilt thou not arise in that day, when my people Israel

  of thy place from the farthest north, and many nations with thee? all of them
  mounted on horses, a great gathering, and a large force? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And thou shalt come up upon my people Israel as a

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> that my wrath and my jealousy shall
  arise, I have spoken in the fire of mine anger, verily in that day there
  shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; <span style=

  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I will be magnified, and

  I will assemble thee, and guide thee, and raise thee up on the extremity of
  the north, and I will bring thee up upon the mountains of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I will destroy the bow out of thy

  on the mountains of Israel; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and thou
  and all that belong to thee shall fall, and the nations that are with thee

  burning with them for seven years: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  and they shall not take any wood out of the field, neither shall they cut any
  out of the forests, but they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall
  plunder those that plundered them, and spoil those that spoiled them, saith
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And it shall come to pass
  that in that day I will give to Gog a place of renown, a tomb in Israel, the
  burial-place of them that approach the sea: and they shall build round about
  the outlet of the valley, and there they shall bury Gog and all his
  multitude: and the place shall then be called the burial-place of Gog.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the house of Israel shall bury

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Yea, all the people of the land shall
  bury them; and it shall be to them a place of renown in the day wherein it
  was glorified, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  they shall appoint men continually to go over the land, to bury them that
  have been left on the face of the earth, to cleanse it after the space of
  seven months, and they shall seek them out. <span style=

  yourselves from all places round about to my sacrifice, which I have made for
  you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, and ye shall eat
  flesh, and drink blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Ye shall eat
  the flesh of mighty men, and ye shall drink the blood of princes of the
  earth, rams, and calves and goats, and they are all fatted calves.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And ye shall eat fat till ye are
  full, and shall drink wine till ye are drunken, of my sacrifice which I have
  prepared for you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And ye shall be
  filled at my table, eating horse, and rider, and mighty man, and every
  warrior, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I will
  set my glory among you, and all the nations shall see my judgment which I
  have wrought, and my hand which I have brought upon them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the house of Israel shall know that I am the
  Lord their God, from this day and onwards. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And all the nations shall know that the house of
  Israel were led captive because of their sins, because they rebelled against
  me, and I turned away my face from them, and delivered them into the hands of
  their enemies, and they all fell by the sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> According to their uncleannesses and according to
  their transgressions did I deal with them, and I turned away my face from
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord
  God, Now will I turn back captivity in Jacob, and will have mercy on the
  house of Israel, and will be jealous for the sake of my holy name.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they shall bear their reproach,
  and the iniquity which they committed when they dwelt upon their land in
  peace. Yet there shall be none to terrify them <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Four on one side and four on the
  other side behind the gate; upon them they kill the victims, in front of the
  eight tables of sacrifices. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And there
  were four tables of hewn stone for whole-burnt-offerings, the breadth of them
  was a cubit and a half, and the length of them two cubits and a half, and
  their height was a cubit: on them they shall place the instruments with which
  they slay there the whole-burnt-offerings and the victims. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And they shall have within a border of hewn stone
  round about of a span broad, and over the tables above screens for covering
  them from the wet and from the heat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span>
  And he brought me into the inner court, and behold there were two chambers in
  the inner court, one behind the gate looking to the north, turning southward,
  and one behind the southern gate, but which looks to the north. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And he said to me, This chamber that looks to the
  south, is for the priests that keep the charge of the house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And the chamber that looks to the north is for
  the priests that keep the charge of the altar: they are the sons of Sadduc,
  those of the tribe of Levi who draw near to the Lord to serve him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And he measured the court, the length
  whereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth a hundred cubits, on its four
  sides; and the altar in front of the house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And he brought me into the porch of the house;
  and he measured the post of the porch, the breadth was five cubits on one
  side and five cubits on the other side; and the breadth of the door was
  fourteen cubits, and the side-pieces of the door of the porch were three
  cubits on one side, and three cubits on the other side. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And the length of the porch was twenty cubits,
  and the breadth twelve cubits; and they went up to it by ten steps; and there
  were pillars to the porch, one on this side and one on that side.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel41">41</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he brought me into the temple,
  the porch of which he measured, six cubits the breadth on one side, and six
  cubits the breadth of the porch on the other side. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the breadth of the gateway was ten cubits, and
  the side-pieces of the gateway were five cubits on this side, and five cubits
  on that side: and he measured the length of it, forty cubits, and the
  breadth, twenty cubits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he went
  into the inner court, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the
  door, six cubits; and the side-pieces of the door, seven cubits on one side,
  and seven cubits on the other side. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And he measured the length of the doors, forty cubits; and the breadth,
  twenty cubits, in front of the temple: and he said, This is the holy of
  holies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he measured the wall of
  the house, six cubits: and the breadth of each side, four cubits round about.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the sides were twice ninety, side
  against side; and there was a space in the wall of the house at the sides
  round about, that they should be for them that take hold of them to see, that
  they should not at all touch the walls of the house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the breadth of the upper side was made
  according to the projection out of the wall, against the upper one round
  about the house, that it might be enlarged above, and that men might go up to
  the upper chambers from those below, and from the ground-sills to the third
  story. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And as for the height of the
  house round about, each space between the sides was equal to a reed of six
  cubits; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and the breadth of the wall of
  each side without was five cubits; and the spaces that were left between the
  sides of the house, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and between the
  chambers, were a width of twenty cubits, the circumference of the house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the doors of the chambers were
  toward the space left by the one door that looked northward, and there was
  one door southward; and the breadth of the remaining open space was five
  cubits in extent round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the
  partition wall in front of the remaining space, toward the west, was seventy
  cubits in breadth; the breadth of the partition wall was five cubits round
  about, and the length of it ninety cubits. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he measured in front of the house a length of
  a hundred cubits, and the remaining spaces and the partitions; and the walls
  thereof were in length a hundred cubits. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the breadth in front of the house, and the
  remaining spaces before it were a hundred cubits. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he measured the length of the partition in
  front of the space left by the back parts of that house; and the spaces left
  on this side and on that side were in length a hundred cubits: and the temple
  and the corners and the outer porch were ceiled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the windows were latticed, giving light round
  about to the three stories, so as to look through: and the house and the
  parts adjoining were planked round about, and so was the floor, and from the
  floor up to the windows, and the window shutters folded back in three parts
  for one to look through. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And almost
  all the way to the inner, and close to the outer side, and upon all the wall
  round about within and without, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> were
  carved cherubs and palm-trees between the cherubs, and each cherub had two
  faces. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The face of a man was toward
  one palm-tree on this side and on that side, and the face of a lion toward
  another palm-tree on this side and on that side: the house was carved all
  round. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> From the floor to the ceiling
  were cherubs and palm-trees carved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And the holy place and the temple opened on four sides; in front of the holy
  places the appearance was as the look of <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> a wooden altar, the height of it three cubits,
  and the length two cubits, and the breadth two cubits; and it had horns, and
  the base of it and the sides of it were of wood: and he said to me, This is
  the table, which is before the face of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the temple had two doors, and the sanctuary
  had two doors, with two turning leaves apiece; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> two leaves to the one, and two leaves to the
  other door. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And there was carved work
  upon them, and cherubs on the doors of the temple, and palm-trees according
  to the carving of the sanctuary; and there were stout planks in front of the
  porch without. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And there were secret
  windows; and he measured from side to side, to the roofing of the porch; and
  the sides of the house were closely planked.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel42">42</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he brought me into the inner
  court eastward, opposite the northern gate: and he brought me in, and behold
  five chambers near the vacant space, and near the northern partition,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> a hundred cubits in length toward the
  north, and in breadth fifty, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  ornamented accordingly as the gates of the inner court, and arranged
  accordingly as the peristyles of the outer court, with triple porticos
  fronting one another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And in front of
  the chambers was a walk ten cubits in breadth, the length reaching to a
  hundred cubits; and their doors were northward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the upper walks were in like manner: for the
  peristyle projected from it, even from the range of columns below, and there
  was a space between; so were there a peristyle and a space between, and so
  were there two porticos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For they were
  triple, and they had not pillars like the pillars of the outer ones:
  therefore they projected from the lower ones and the middle ones from the
  ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And there was light without,
  corresponding to the chambers of the outer court looking toward the front of
  the northern chambers; the length of them was fifty cubits. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the length of the chambers looking toward the
  inner court was fifty cubits, and these are the ones that front the others;
  the whole was a hundred cubits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  there were doors of these chambers for an outlet toward the east, so that one
  should go through them out of the outer court, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> by the opening of the walk at the corner; and the
  south parts were toward the south, toward the remaining space, and toward the
  partition, and so were the chambers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And the walk was in front of them, according to the measures of the chambers
  toward the north, both according to the length of them, and according to the
  breadth of them, and according to all their openings, an according to all
  their turnings, and according to their lights, and according to their doors.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> So were the measures of the chambers
  toward the south, and according to the doors at the entrance of the walk, as
  it were the distance of a reed for light, and eastward as one went in by
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to me, The chambers
  toward the north, and the chambers toward the south, in front of the void
  spaces, these are the chambers of the sanctuary, wherein the priests the sons
  of Sadduc, who draw night to the Lord, shall eat the most holy things: and
  there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat-offering, and the
  sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings; because the place is holy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> None shall go in thither except the
  priests, and they shall not go forth of the holy place into the outer court,
  that they that draw nigh to me may be continually holy, and may not touch
  their garments in which they minister, with defilement, for they are holy;
  and they shall put on other garments whenever they come in contact with the
  people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> So the measurement of the
  house within was accomplished: and he brought me forth by the way of the gate
  that looks eastward, and measured the plan of the house round about in order.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he stood behind the gate looking
  eastward, and measured five hundred cubits with the measuring reed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he turned to the north and
  measured in front of the north side five hundred cubits with the measuring
  reed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he turned to the west, and
  measured in front of the west side, five hundred cubits with the measuring
  reed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he turned to the south, and
  measured in front of the south side, five hundred cubits by the measuring
  reed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The four sides he measured by
  the same reed, and he marked out the house and the circumference of the parts
  round about, a space of five hundred cubits eastward, and a breadth of five
  hundred cubits, to make a division between the sanctuary and the outer wall,
  that belonged to the design of the house.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel43">43</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Moreover he brought me to the gate
  looking eastward, and led me forth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came by the eastern way; and
  there was a voice of an army, as the sound of many redoubling their shouts,
  and the earth shone like light from the glory round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the vision which I saw was like the vision
  which I saw when I went in to anoint the city: and the vision of the chariot
  which I saw was like the vision which I saw at the river Chobar; and I fell
  upon my face. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the glory of the
  Lord came into the house, by the way of the gate looking eastward.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Spirit took me up, and brought
  me into the inner court; and, behold, the house of the Lord was full of
  glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I stood, and behold there
  was a voice out of the house of one speaking to me, and a man stood near me,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and he said to me, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> when they set my door-way by their door-way, and
  my thresholds near to their thresholds: and they made my wall as it were
  joining myself and them, and they profaned my holy name with their iniquities
  which they wrought: and I destroyed them in my wrath and with slaughter.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And now let them put away from me
  their fornication, and the murders of their princes, and I will dwell in the
  midst of them forever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou, son
  of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may cease from their
  sins; and shew its aspect and the arrangement of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they shall bear their punishment for all the
  things that they have done: and thou shalt describe the house, and its
  entrances, and the plan thereof, and all its ordinances, and thou shalt make
  known to them all the regulations of it, and describe them before them: and
  they shall keep all my commandments, and all my ordinances, and do them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thou shalt shew the plan of the
  house on the top of the mountain: all its limits round about shall be most
  holy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And these are the measures of
  the altar by the cubit of a cubit and a span, the cavity shall be a cubit
  deep, and a cubit shall be the breadth, and the border on the rim of it round
  about shall be a span: and this shall be the height of the altar <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> from the bottom at the commencement of the hollow
  part to this great mercy-seat, from beneath was two cubits, and the breadth
  was a cubit; and from the little mercy-seat to the great mercy-seat, four
  cubits, and the breadth was a cubit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and above the horns a
  cubit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the altar shall be of the
  length of twelve cubits, by twelve cubits in breadth, square upon its four
  sides. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the mercy-seat shall be
  fourteen cubits in length, by fourteen cubits in breadth on its four sides;
  and there shall be a border to it carried round about it of half a cubit; and
  the rim of it shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof looking
  eastward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he said to me, Son of
  man, thus saith the Lord God of Israel; These are the ordinances of the altar
  in the day of its being made, to offer upon it whole-burnt-offerings, and to
  pour blood upon it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And thou shalt
  appoint to the priests the Levites of the seed of Sadduc, that draw nigh to
  me, saith the Lord God, to minister to me, a calf of the herd for a
  sin-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they shall take of
  its blood, and shall put it on the four horns of the altar, and upon the four
  corners of the propitiatory, and upon the base round about, and they shall
  make atonement for it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And they shall
  take the calf of the sin-offering, and it shall be consumed by fire in the
  separate place of the house, outside the sanctuary. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And on the second day they shall take two kids of
  the goats without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall make atonement
  for the altar, as they made atonement with the calf. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And after they have finished the atonement, they
  shall bring an unblemished calf of the herd, and an unblemished ram of the
  flock. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And ye shall offer them before
  the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them, and shall offer them
  up as whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Seven days shalt thou offer a kid daily for a
  sin-offering, and a calf of the herd, and a ram out of the flock: they shall
  sacrifice them unblemished for seven days: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and they shall make atonement for the altar, and
  shall purge it; and they shall consecrate themselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And it shall come to pass from the eighth day and
  onward, that the priests shall offer your whole-burnt-offerings on the altar,
  and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel44">44</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then he brought me back by the way
  of the outer gate of the sanctuary that looks eastward; and it was shut.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord said to me, This gate
  shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no one shall pass through it; for
  the Lord God of Israel shall enter by it, and it shall be shut. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the prince, he shall sit in it, to eat bread
  before the Lord; he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and
  shall go forth by the way of the same. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And he brought me in by the way of the gate that looks northward, in front of
  the house: and I looked, and, behold, the house was full of the glory of the
  Lord: and I fell upon my face. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the
  Lord said to me, Son of man, attend with thine heart, and see with thine
  eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to thee, according to all the
  ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the regulations thereof; and
  thou shalt attend well to the entrance of the house, according to all its
  outlets, in all the holy things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  thou shalt say to the provoking house, even to the house of Israel, Thus
  saith the Lord God; Let it suffice you to have committed all your iniquities,
  O house of Israel! <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> that ye have
  brought in aliens, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be
  in my sanctuary, and to profane it, when ye offered bread, flesh, and blood;
  and ye transgressed my covenant by all your iniquities; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and ye appointed others to keep the charges in my
  sanctuary. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore thus saith the
  Lord God; No alien, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall
  enter into my sanctuary, of all the children of strangers that are in the
  midst of the house of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But as
  for the Levites who departed far from me when Israel went astray from me
  after their imaginations, they shall even bear their iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> yet they shall minister in my sanctuary, being
  porters at the gates of the house, and serving the house: they shall slay the
  victims and the whole-burnt-offerings for the people, and they shall stand
  before the people to minister to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Because they ministered to them before their
  idols, and it became to the house of Israel a punishment of iniquity;
  therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they shall not draw nigh to me to
  minister to me in the priests’ office, nor to approach the holy things of the
  children of Israel, nor to approach my holy of holies: but they shall bear
  their reproach for the error wherein they erred. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> They shall bring them to keep the charges of the
  house, for all the service of it, and for all that they shall do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The priests the Levites, the sons of
  Sadduc, who kept the charges of my sanctuary when the house of Israel went
  astray from me, these shall draw night to me to minister to me, and shall
  stand before my face, to offer sacrifice to me, the fat and the blood, saith
  the Lord God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> These shall enter into
  my sanctuary, and these shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they
  shall keep my charges. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it shall
  come to pass when they enter the gates of the inner court, that they shall
  put on linen robes; and they shall not put on woollen garments when they
  minister at the gate of the inner court. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they shall have linen mitres upon their
  heads, and shall have linen drawers upon their loins; and they shall not
  tightly gird themselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And when
  they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their
  robes, in which they minister; and they shall lay them up in the chambers of
  the sanctuary, and shall put on other robes, and they shall not sanctify the
  people with their robes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they
  shall not shave their heads, nor shall they pluck off their hair; they shall
  carefully cover their heads. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And no
  priest shall drink any wine, when they go into the inner court. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Neither shall they take to themselves to wife a
  widow, or one that is put away, but a virgin of the seed of Israel: but if
  there should happen to be a priest’s widow, they shall take her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they shall teach my people to distinguish
  between holy and profane, and they shall make known to them the difference
  between unclean and clean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And these
  shall attend at a judgment of blood to decide it: they shall rightly observe
  my ordinances, and judge my judgments, and keep my statutes and my
  commandments in all my feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they shall not go in to the dead
  body of a man to defile themselves: only a priest may defile himself for a
  father, or for a mother, or for a son, or for a daughter, or for a brother,
  or for his sister, who has not been married. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And after he has been cleansed, let him number to
  himself seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And on whatsoever
  day they shall enter into the inner court to minister in the holy place, they
  shall bring a propitiation, saith the Lord God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And it shall be to them for an inheritance: I am
  their inheritance: and no possession shall be given them among the children
  of Israel; for I am their possession. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  And these shall eat the meat-offerings, and the sin-offerings, and the
  trespass-offerings; and every special offering in Israel shall be theirs.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the first-fruits of all things,
  and the first-born of all animals and all offerings, of all your first-fruits
  there shall be a share for the priests; and ye shall give your earliest
  produce to the priest, to bring your blessings upon your houses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the priests shall eat no bird or beast that
  dies of itself, or is taken of wild beasts.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel45">45</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And when ye measure the land for
  inheritance, ye shall set apart first-fruits to the Lord, a holy space of the
  land, in length twenty and five thousand reeds, and in breadth twenty
  thousand; it shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And there shall be a sanctuary out of
  this, five hundred reeds in length by five hundred in breadth, a square round
  about; and there shall be a vacant space beyond this of fifty cubits round
  about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And out of this measurement
  shalt thou measure the length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth
  twenty thousand: and in it shall be the holy of holies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Of the land shall be a portion for the priests
  that minister in the holy place, and it shall be for them that draw nigh to
  minister to the Lord: and it shall be to them a place for houses set apart
  for their sacred office; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> the length
  shall be twenty-five thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand: and the
  Levites that attend the house, they shall have cities to dwell in for a
  possession. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye shall appoint for
  the possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and in length
  twenty-five thousand: after the manner of the first-fruits of the holy
  portion, they shall be for all the house of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the prince shall have a portion out of this,
  and out of this there shall be a portion for the first-fruits of the
  sanctuary, and for the possession of the city, in front of the first-fruits
  of the sanctuary, and in front of the possession of the city westward, and
  from the western parts eastward: and the length shall be equal to one of the
  parts of the western borders, and the length shall be to the eastern borders
  of the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he shall have it for
  a possession in Israel: and the princes of Israel shall no more oppress my
  people; but the house of Israel shall inherit the land according to their
  tribes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thus saith the Lord God; Let
  it suffice you, ye princes of Israel: remove injustice and misery, execute
  judgment and justice; take away oppression from my people, saith the Lord
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Ye shall have a just balance,
  and a just measure, and a just choenix for measure. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And in like manner there shall be one choenix as
  a measure of capacity; the tenth of the gomor shall be the choenix, and the
  tenth of the gomor shall be in fair proportion to the gomor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the weights shall be twenty oboli, your pound
  shall be five shekels, fifteen shekels and fifty shekels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And these are the first-fruits which ye shall
  offer; a sixth part of a gomor of wheat, and the sixth part of it shall
  consist of an ephah of a core of barley. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And ye shall give as the appointed measure of oil
  one bath of oil out of ten baths; for ten baths are a gomor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And one sheep from the flock out of ten, as an
  oblation from all the tribes of Israel, for sacrifices, and for
  whole-burnt-offerings, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for you,
  saith the Lord God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And all the
  people shall give these first-fruits to the prince of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And through the prince shall be offered the
  whole-burnt-offerings and the meat-offerings, and the drink-offerings in the
  feasts, and at the new moons, and on the sabbaths; and in all the feasts of
  the house of Israel: he shall offer the sin-offerings, and the meat-offering,
  and the whole-burnt-offerings, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for
  the house of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord God; In the first month, on the first day of the month, ye shall take a
  calf without blemish out of the herd, to make atonement for the holy place.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the priest shall take of the
  blood of the atonement, and put it on the thresholds of the house, and upon
  the four corners of the temple, and upon the altar, and upon the thresholds
  of the gate of the inner court. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  thus shalt thou do in the seventh month; on the first day of the month thou
  shalt take a rate from each one; and ye shall make atonement for the house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And in the first month, on the
  fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the feast of the passover; seven
  days shall ye eat unleavened bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And the prince shall offer in that day a calf for a sin-offering for himself,
  and the house, and for all the people of the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And for the seven days of the feast he shall
  offer as whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord seven calves and seven rams
  without blemish daily for the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a
  sin-offering, and a meat-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And thou shalt prepare a cake for the calf, and cakes for the ram, and a hin
  of oil for the cake. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And in the
  seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, thou shalt sacrifice in the
  feast in the same way seven days, as they sacrificed the sin-offerings, and
  the whole-burnt-offerings, and the freewill-offering, and the oil.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel46">46</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thus saith the Lord God; The gate
  that is in the inner court, that looks eastward, shall be shut the six
  working days; but let it be opened on the sabbath-day, and it shall be opened
  on the day of the new moon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the
  prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the inner gate, and shall stand
  at the entrance of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his
  whole-burnt-offerings and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the
  entrance of the gate: then shall he come forth; but the gate shall not be
  shut till evening. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the people of
  the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate, both on the sabbaths and
  at the new moons, before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  the prince shall offer whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord on the sabbath-day,
  six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and a freewill-offering, a meat-offering for the
  ram, and a meat-offering for the lambs, the gift of his hand, and a hin of
  oil for the meat-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And on the
  day of the new moon a calf without blemish, and six lambs, and there shall be
  a ram without blemish; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and a
  meat-offering for the ram, and there shall be a meat-offering for the calf as
  a freewill-offering, and for the lambs, according as his hand can furnish,
  and there shall be a hin of oil for the cake. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And when the prince goes in, he shall go in by the
  way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way of the gate.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And whenever the people of the land
  shall go in before the Lord at the feasts, he that goes in by the way of the
  north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he
  that goes in by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the
  north gate: he shall not return by the gate by which he entered, but he shall
  go forth opposite it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the prince
  shall enter with them in the midst of them when they go in; and when they go
  forth, he shall go forth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And in the
  feasts and in the general assemblies the freewill oblation shall be a
  meat-offering for the calf, and a meat-offering for the ram, and for the
  lambs, as his hand can furnish, and a hin of oil for the meat-offering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And if the prince should prepare as a
  thanksgiving a whole-burnt-peace-offering to the Lord, and should open for
  himself the gate looking eastward, and offer his whole-burnt-offering, and
  his peace-offerings, as he does on the sabbath-day; then shall he go out, and
  shall shut the doors after he has gone out. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he shall prepare daily as a
  whole-burnt-offering to the Lord a lamb of a year old without blemish: in the
  morning shall he prepare it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he
  shall prepare a freewill-offering for it in the morning, the sixth part of a
  measure of flour, and a third part of a hin of oil to mix therewith the fine
  flour, as a freewill-offering to the Lord, a perpetual ordinance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Ye shall prepare the lamb, and the
  freewill-offering, and the oil in the morning, for a perpetual
  whole-burnt-sacrifice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord God; If the prince shall give a gift to one of his sons out of his
  inheritance, this shall be to his sons a possession as an inheritance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But if he give a gift to one of his
  servants, then it shall belong to him until the year of release; and then he
  shall restore it to the prince: but of the inheritance of his sons the
  possession shall continue to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And the prince shall by no means take of the inheritance of the people, to
  oppress them: he shall give an inheritance to his sons out of his own
  possession: that my people be not scattered, every one from his possession.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he brought me into the entrance
  of the place behind the gate, into the chamber of the sanctuary belonging to
  the priests, that looks toward the north: and, behold, there was a place set
  apart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he said to me, This is the
  place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offerings and the
  sin-offerings, and there shall they bake the meat-offering always; so as not
  to carry them out into the outer court, to sanctify the people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he brought me into the outer court, and led
  me round upon the four sides of the court; and, behold, there was a court on
  each of the sides of the court, <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> on
  every side a court, even a court for all the four sides, and each little
  court belonging to the court was in length forty cubits, and in breadth
  thirty cubits, there was one measure to the four. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And there were chambers in them round about,
  round about the four, and cooking-places formed under the chambers round
  about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he said to me, These are
  the cooks’ houses, where they that serve the house shall boil the sacrifices
  of the people.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel47">47</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he brought me to the entrance
  of the house; and, behold, water issued from under the porch eastward, for
  the front of the house looked eastward; and the water came down from the
  right side, from the south to the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he brought me out by the way of the northern
  gate, and he led me round by the way outside to the gate of the court that
  looks eastward; and, behold, water came down from the right side,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> in the direction in which a man went
  forth opposite; and there was a measuring line in his hand, and he measured a
  thousand cubits with the measure; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and
  he passed through the water; it was water of a fountain: and again he
  measured a thousand, and passed through the water; and the water was up to
  the thighs: and again he measured a thousand; and he passed through water up
  to the loins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and again he measured a
  thousand; and he could not pass through: for the water rose as of a torrent
  which men cannot pass over. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he
  said to me, Hast thou seen this, son of man? Then he brought me, and led me
  back to the brink of the river <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> as I
  returned; and, behold, on the brink of the river there were very many trees
  on this side and on that side. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he
  said to me, This is the water that goes forth to Galilee that lies eastward,
  and it is gone down to Arabia, and has reached as far as to the sea to the
  outlet of the water: and it shall heal the waters. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And it shall come to pass, that every animal of
  living and moving creatures, all on which the river shall come, shall live:
  and there shall be there very many fish; for this water shall go thither, and
  it shall heal them, and they shall live: everything on which the river shall
  come shall live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And fishers shall
  stand there from Ingadin to Enagallim; it shall be a place to spread out nets
  upon; it shall be distinct; and the fishes thereof shall be as the fishes of
  the great sea, a very great multitude. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But at the outlet of the water, and the turn of
  it, and where it overflows its banks, they shall not heal at all; they are
  given to salt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And every fruit tree
  shall grow by the river, even on the bank of it on this side and on that
  side: they shall not decay upon it, neither shall their fruit fail: they
  shall bring forth the first-fruit of their early crop, for these their waters
  come forth of the sanctuary: and their fruit shall be for meat, and their
  foliage for health. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord God; Ye shall inherit these borders of the land; they are given by lot
  to the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And ye shall inherit it, each according to his
  brother’s portion, even the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give
  it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you by lot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And these are the borders of the land that lies
  northward, from the great sea that comes down, and divides the entrance of
  Emaseldam; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Maabthera, Ebrameliam,
  between the coasts of Damascus and the coasts of Emathi, the habitation of
  Saunan, which places are above the coasts of Auranitis. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> These are the borders from the sea, from the
  habitations of Ænan, the coasts of Damascus, and the northern coasts.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the eastern coasts between
  Loranitis, and Damascus, and the land of Galaad, and the land of Israel, the
  Jordan divides to the sea that is east of the city of palm-trees. These are
  the eastern coasts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the southern
  and south-western coasts are from Thaeman and the city of palm-trees, to the
  water of Marimoth Cadem, reaching forth to the great sea. This part is the
  south and south-west. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> This part of
  the great sea forms a border, till one comes opposite the entrance of Emath,
  even as far as the entrance thereof. These are the parts west of Emath.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> So ye shall divide this land to them,
  even to the tribes of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Ye
  shall cast the lot upon it, for yourselves and the strangers that sojourn in
  the midst of you, who have begotten children in the midst of you: and they
  shall be to you as natives among the children of Israel; they shall eat with
  you in their inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they shall be in the tribe of proselytes
  among the proselytes that are with them: there shall ye give them an
  inheritance, saith the Lord God.</p>

  <h3 id="ezekiel48">48</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And these are the names of the
  tribes from the northern corner, on the side of the descent that draws a line
  to the entrance of Emath the palace of Ælam, the border of Damascus northward
  on the side of Emath the palace; and they shall have the eastern parts as far
  as the sea, for Dan, one portion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  from the borders of Dan eastward as far as the west sea-coast, for Asser,
  one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And from the borders of Asser,
  from the eastern parts as far as the west coasts, for Nephthalim, one.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And from the borders of Nephthalim,

  parts as far as the west coasts, for Juda, one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And from the borders of Juda, from the eastern
  parts shall be the offering of first-fruits, in the breadth twenty-five
  thousand reeds, and in length as one of the portions measured from the east
  even to the western parts: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> As for the first-fruits which they
  shall offer to the Lord, it shall be in length twenty-five thousand, and in
  breadth twenty-five thousand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Out of
  this shall be the first-fruits of the holy things to the priests, northward,
  five and twenty-thousand, and towards the west, ten thousand, and southward,
  five and twenty thousand: and the mountain of the sanctuary, shall be in the
  midst of it, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> for the priests, for the
  consecrated sons of Sadduc, who keep the charges of the house, who erred not
  in the error of the children of Israel, as the Levites erred. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the first-fruits shall be given to them out
  of the first-fruits of the land, even a most holy portion from the borders of
  the Levites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Levites shall
  have the part, next to the borders of the priests, in length twenty-five
  thousand, and in breadth ten thousand: the whole length shall be five and
  twenty thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> No part of it shall be sold, nor measured as for
  sale, neither shall the first-fruits of the land be taken away: for they are
  holy to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But concerning the
  five thousand that remain in the breadth in the five and twenty thousand,
  they shall be a suburb to the city for dwelling, and for a space before it:
  and the city shall be in the midst thereof. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And these shall be its dimensions; from the
  northern side four thousand and five hundred, and from the southern side four
  thousand and five hundred, and from the eastern side four thousand and five
  hundred, and from the western side they shall measure four thousand five
  hundred. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And there shall be a space
  to the city northward two hundred and fifty, and southward two hundred and
  fifty, and eastward two hundred and fifty, and westward two hundred and
  fifty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the remainder of the
  length that is next to the first-fruits of the holy portion shall be ten
  thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and they shall be the
  first-fruits of the sanctuary; and the fruits thereof shall be for bread to
  them that labour for the city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  they that labour for the city shall labour for it out of all the tribes of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The whole offering shall be a
  square of twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand: ye shall separate
  again part of it, the first-fruits of the sanctuary, from the possession of
  the city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the prince shall have
  the remainder on this side and on that side from the first-fruits of the
  sanctuary, and there shall be a possession of the city, for five and twenty
  thousand cubits in length, to the eastern and western borders, for five and
  twenty thousand to the western borders, next to the portions of the prince;
  and the first-fruits of the holy things and the sanctuary of the house shall
  be in the midst of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And there
  shall be a portion taken from the Levites, from the possession of the city in
  the midst of the princes between the borders of Juda and the borders of
  Benjamin, and it shall be the portion of the princes. <span style=

  the water of Barimoth Cades, for an inheritance, unto the great sea.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> This is the land, which ye shall
  divide by lot to the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, saith
  the Lord God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And these are the
  goings out of the city northward, four thousand and five hundred by measure.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the gates of the city shall be
