# EPUB files are large (though not too large for GitHub). We don't persist them
# for the following reasons:
# 1. To save some space, and keep our repo size under control. (#139)
# 2. Because the pipeline is nondeterministic, meaning that running it twice
# would produce different results, which dirties our worktree and makes some
# operations complex. (#152, #220)
# 3. We publish them to Drive, and this has generally been our approach towards
# "opaque" data that gets published. It's opaque in the sense that we can't run
# `git diff` against it to inspect the impact that a given change has on the
# output data. The Bible EPUB has a `diff`-able counterpart, namely the HTML.

# Our environment variables and helpers are defined in `.env`. In case you want
# to supplement them with your own, you can do so in `.myenv`.
# If you do so, then the following should make things slightly easier for you:
# 1. Add the following line to `.myenv`, so you only need to source one file:
#    ```
#    source .env
#    ```
# 2. Add a hook to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` that sources `.myenv` once you
# `cd` into the repo directory. (Or do so with `.env` if you don't use a
# `.myenv`.)
