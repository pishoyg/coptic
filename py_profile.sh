#
# NOTE: While we don't take the liberty to do that for you, if your program uses
# concurrent execution, and you want to profile the spawned tasks as well, you
# should set the SEQUENTIAL environment variable to force sequential execution,
# as cProfile is unable to profile concurrent code.
# This is assuming that your script uses our concurrency primitives, which
# respect this environment variable.

set -o nounset  # Consider an undefined variable to be an error.
