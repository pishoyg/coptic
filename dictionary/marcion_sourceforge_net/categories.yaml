# TODO: (#330): Make it possible for one category to link other related
# categories.
# Perhaps wrap categories in double square brackets, or some other markers, and
# have your parser link them appropriately.
# TODO (#330) Add some styling to the category descriptions. For example, some
# text should be italicized.

# The list of word categories is likely to evolve as we work on categorizing
# more and more words.
# For the time being, we have paid more attention to categorizing nouns in
# particular.
# It is generally acceptable for some words to belong to several categories,
# though our categories should be selected such that such cases are uncommon.
# As much as possible, aim to provide very precise definitions of each category,
# to minimize uncertainty during the labeling process.
